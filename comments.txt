~u better buy your mom another one bro
~I love arun but the fact that he said super Mario bros 3 is bad is unacceptable
~since you bought 3 knives instead of one, I think it would be better if the joke was &quot;very knives&quot; instead of very &quot;knife&quot;

~My dad spent $8000 on the speakers At the beginning
~I would expect a little more research in a video like this :/<br>Most of the things bought in this video should&#39;ve been obvious, that they&#39;re bad quality overprices products. Also, the Razer Viper Mini SE can do 4000hz polling, not 8000. (I guess you&#39;ve seen the Viper 8K, which is a wired mouse, and might have confused it with this).
