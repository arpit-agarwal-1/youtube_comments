3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZB7jOH3Reg,Most Ingenious Construction Inventions & Advanced Working Technology ▶4,593884,4036,55,Quantum Tech HD,0,"['Amazing Technology ✔', 'Muito legal!!!', 'Technology is slowly changing lives in amazing ways', '🕳🕳🕳🕳🕳Осветите, пожалуйста, тему реальных летающих тарелок земного происхождения. В Конгрессе США недавно были слушания на эту тему...  Есть технология - плазменные двигательные панели, расположены в виде круглых зон по периметру и на днище летательного аппарата, а плазменный импульс создают ячейки в виде микрорельсотронов. Если на рельсовые контакты подать электроток, индукция разгоняет искру замыкающую контакты до космических скоростей. Понятно, что импульс, создаваемый рельсотроном, можно использовать не только для выстрела, но и для движения. Поэтому достаточно давно на космических аппаратах устанавливают импульсные двигатели, которые в нужный момент выстреливают плазмой для перехода с одной орбиты на другую. Есть статья в журнале МАИ «Абляционный импульсный плазменный двигатель». Но такие двигатели крупные: струя плазмы возникает при сгорании пластиковой заглушки между электродами. А у двигательных плазменных панелей, где соединены вместе мини-разрядники ячеек (как у плазменных телевизоров), там рельсотроны уменьшены до размеров шариковой ручки, собраны в плоские панели, которые по конструкции напоминают плазменные панели телевизоров. Расстояние между контактами незначительно - до 1 мм - перемычкой между ними становится искра разряда. Работают ячейки синхронно: стреляют струйками плазмы – искрами электроразрядов, ускоренных силой индукции. Скорость большая, количество рельсотронов в панелях доходит до сотен тысяч - суммарный двигательный импульс в итоге огромен! Разряды идут с мегагерцевой частотой, каждый импульс ударяет о воздух, который завихряется в тороидальные кольца. Эти двигательные панели используются для летательных аппаратов в атмосфере: снизу и по движению создается импульсами плазменных панелей столб кольцевых вихрей - так и летает... В вихревой струе, за счет вращения воздуха, падает температура – влага из воздуха вымораживается снежинками, на которых искрится свет, созданный электроразрядами панели. Получается некий «твердый луч», который при покачивании аппарата изгибается за счет искривления траектории отлетающих вихревых колец. Впрочем, эта технология совсем не супер. Летают они быстро и маневренны - из-за легкости аппарата, но от импульсных плазменных двигателей - микроволновое излучение. Грузоподъемность низка. Радиосвязи нет.

My father forgot to bring a new flashlight with him. My flashlight had a low battery and was useless. 45 minutes in I returned home to fetch the flashlight my father forgot. Only to hear noises from the master bedroom to be that of my father getting into bed. \n\nAfter finding my father I contacted my mother, then my sister, and then the police. Took our little Yorkie out myself who was quite happy to empty her bladder and bowels. \n\nThings then went downhill from there. Turns out dementia is not limited to the brain. My mother began these spells where she'd collapse to the floor for no reason. This went on for about a year. One day her gallbladder ruptured after a fall. My sister and my father helped my mother into bed. She kept asking for more blankets despite it being 72 degrees in the house.  She began shaking though not shivering . My sister said I was nuts wanting to call emergency service. I saved her life.\n\nThen the bad news a year later. She had a stroke. She recovered from the stroke but still fell down and eventually gave up knitting and solving puzzles. Further testing revealed a diagnosis I would NEVER wish on anyone. Lewy Body Dementia. You still have your wits about you. The ability to do almost anything... not so much. Walk. Stand. Eat. Drink... You can't do anything on your own. Her second stroke was the final nail. It was all downhill from there.

I say that as a past fan who really took their reviews to heart including spending thousands on hardware some of which I watched LTT review.', '+', 'f**k you, f**k lmg. Everything has problems and nobody is perfect (that doesn\'t mean ltt\'s problems aren\'t serious), but sending 5 million people to hate on that single company doesn\'t make you innocent. You pull up an excuse out of your a_ss that it\'s very uncomfortable to make that video and that many people could turn up against you. But if a large amount of people (90% for example) is at 1 opinion, guess where a person that doesn\'t have a view of both sides of  the situation would go!? That though doesn\'t mean anything, some people say that\'s it\'s modern to be opposite, but that\'s getting too political. The chance for that expose video to completely backfire at you (as I think you say) is lower than to win the lottery. There are 2 ways in my opinion that it can backfire - either the audience realizes you are talking bs *(which you aren\'t)* or LTT to make a video against you, similarly to a yellow press. I mean a company apparently worth $100m wouldn\'t fight fire with fire. As we already saw they decided to reply ""indirectly"" - without mentioning anything exact, which I\'ve seen a lot of companies/influencers do after being exposed. I see that you provided stats for most of the stuff, but for some you just left them as conspiracies that somebody has to verify, for example I remember you said that they bias and give higher results to Noctua, bc they work for them, but I didn\'t saw you provide statistics. That again doesn\'t mean anything. Correct me if I\'m wrong about anything, I admit that I watched the video at 1.5 speed and skipped a bit of the error parts (exactly gpu, cpu, cooler and asterisked errors), because I watched them briefly a few days ago. I also see that at the beginning of the video you say that it\'s really uncomfortable, then say that you don\'t care and you want to address this out, then again say it\'s uncomfortable and it can really easily backfire (and if we look at the stats, it didn\'t backfire). Imo you shouldn\'t do that - you either say that this is an expose video and you don\'t care if you damage the company, or you try to not damage the company. Even my 5iq brain can get some ideas on how to not damage anything - e.g. maybe contact them privately, address the problems and put them an ultimatum, that if they don\'t fix them in x amount of time, you are going to publish the video. The chance of them rejecting the ultimatum, knowing what consequences they would have, is also less than winning the lottery. After they fix their problems, you are going to be able to take credits. Rn your like to dislike ratio is 98%, I doubt it would be under that if you decided to contact them privately and use my 5iq strategy. \n\nAt least some exposing youtubers say to not send hate to the targeted person. It doesn\'t work almost all of the time, but at least it\'s better than saying that it\'s uncomfortable, then saying you don\'t care, then 1 minute later again saying it\'s uncomfortable. \nenough essay for today', 'Excellent video!

Now it's a corpo they only care about money and not about quality.\n\nLinus also pisses money up the wall for videos, so not spending $500 extra to review a genuine product is a joke when he's spent hundreds of thousands on milling machines and all his CNC stuff just so they can build janky ass components purely for 1 video.\n\nLinus has become someone not to be trusted, his statements are always so false as well. He's done more apology videos than anybody on youtube."", ""It's always annoying when a person wants to say something about someone but they just keep sighing and sighing some more like just say it.

Instead, he started with a rant of a forum post that left him looking like a liar with the Billet Labs situation, on top of him trying to blame others for the situation. With his team growing as it has and moving locations, someone at logistics screwed up, and he\'s bearing the brunt of the criticism as the face of the company. Instead of owning the mistake, he claimed they had reached an agreement with Billet, when in reality, they had just sent an email to Billet with no consent to am agreement from Billet\'s end. He always seems somewhat trustworthy, but that lie was the end of my respect for him and his operation. The mess with the SA allegations has yet to receive concrete evidence, so the jury\'s out on that. The ""apology"" video was better, but still somewhat tone-deaf. I hate to see it take a hit like this, but I hope this is a wake-up call for him and his staff. Fix the erroneous data, clean up testing processes, don\'t throw shade at competition without good cause (especially if you can\'t take the response), and just don\'t lie. If he had just said from the start that there was an internal organization error that led to a further communication error, this could have blown over. That compounded with the travesty of a ""test"" and video they did with that product before this whole debacle blew up is what shattered public trust. Then LTT went and sent emails to the folks that participated in the auction asking for what they won under the guise of needing those records for tax purposes, when they were actually just trying to cover up bad bookkeeping and find out who had the waterblock to make an offer for its return.\n\nI can\'t speak for the accusation of ethics thrown back at Gamers Nexus, but given how quickly this followed behind LTX, I imagine something more than a Labs employee badmouthing them in a tour occurred to trigger the release of the video bombshell. It may have just been seeing the Billet Labs waterblock for sale. The video was coming one way or another as a callout for LTT to improve their testing, but something happened to expedite it, I feel. The waterblock situation pushed it over the edge. The allegations of internal issues seemed to be dogpiling without firm evidence at first, and they are certainly best to shut up and handle that internally and via lawyers until claims are either substantiated or undermined.

A modern medium to upper grade fresh food storage unit for your kitchen is NO LONGER a refrigerator  it is now a COMPUTER, designed so one of its\' functions is to keep your food cold.\nDon\'t expect these computers to last 30 years. Well, the computer might. But the cooling system, that\'s another story. Just because you paid $2500 to $3500 doesn\'t mean it\'s going to last ONE DAY past the one year manufacturers warranty. I\'d say the average unit today will give you 7 years without an expensive, if not catastrophic failure. If you get ten years out of one, hang on to it !!! There are a few models that are (by chance) well designed and balanced quite well and are achieving lifespans that the rest of the field envy. I know of a couple SAMSUNG designs that have only one small component that will fail, and can be ELIMINATED with a wire nut and forgotten. Good luck finding a technician that understands this, has experienced it, and will be honest enough to explain the repair and charge you just enough so that he makes a buck or two and you don\'t feel ripped off. Even if your bill was $500 you would still be money ahead, for sure. Especially if, while he/she had the experience and wherewithall to do a slight defrost drain modification for that compartment while it was disassembled. Now, for sure, most techs I\'ve encountered have no idea what I\'m speaking of, sadly, and don\'t have the authorization, company policy, or courage to think outside the box that\'s required for these quite effective repairs. Sad. Aside from the inherent defrost drain problems the manufactures might now have corrected, these units really keep on kicking. Quite accurately, and extremely efficiently.\nNow, in defense of the ""explosive\' refrigerant used in more and more domestic units, don\'t be afraid. It is purified butane, sure it is, but like he said, the charge is only 1.5 to 3.5 liquid ounces. At the top end that\'s about 50 bic lighters, roughly. Believe me, it would be nearly impossible, even if you knew what you were doing and tried, to cause a fire without obvious evidence of the ridiculous effort put forth to do so. Furthermore, butane is not only cheap,  it is BY FAR THE MOST EFFICIENT REFRIGERANT EVER USED in the history of refrigeration. The chemicals that Du Pont developed and made $BILLIONS from, and now the field of refrigerants is more of a forest, were unnecessary for the most part, and totally unnecessary for domestic refrigerator freezer unit s since mechanical refrigerators were invented. AND-- get this- the electrical requirements, or power consumption, is roughly ONE THIRD the power required to use the chemical refrigerants, to produce the same amount of cooling. That stuff is QUICK I\'m telling ya!! Do I have it in my own refrigerator? Come onnn now, of course I do, all 2.78 ounces of the stuff. And I sleep peacefully in the full knowledge regarding it\'s safety. And butane is very low on the greenhouse gas list of culprits. So all these decades and decades of billions of refrigerators running could have been using , say, 60% less energy. That is one HELLUVALOT of electricity. Think about it.\nSo there. I rest my case.\nOh WAIT!!- That story regarding the oil in the compressor and blah-blah-blah is total nonsense in any modern unit. In fact you could flip his dehumidifier on its head or roll it across the room and towards an outlet and plug it right in. I\'ve done these tests and more, much more. \nGo ahead, be careful. Be scared. Do what you gotta do. I\'m just telling you the truth.\nAnd by the way, a lit cigarette WILL NOT ignite gasoline fumes. Contrary to Hollywood and other trusted sources lying to everyone alla the time, it won\'t light gas, even if you hold the cigarette over an open gas puddle and puff on it until it is CHERRY RED HOT, the fuel will simply not ignite. In fact you could then extinguish said cigarette in the puddle of liquid gasoline. Yep.

The fact that you miscontrued Linus' positions on unionization and alike still remains, too, and given how this video starts, you are obviously not willing to admit it or simply still unaware of it.\nThat video might have been downvoted as much as it was because of fanboy activity, I do not know. It still was not a good video, however. You took things out of context or deliberately misunderstood them. You cited sources that simply were not verifiable and still took what they said more or less as fact. And I still would assume that you did these things for clout.

It was probably just the algorithm picking up your video and people not liking it. Most likely fans of the LTT channel getting a video regarding LTT recommended to them by YouTube. The whole ""a fanbase being toxic against negativity towards their fandom"", isn\'t exactly new. It happens to anyone with a large (or small) platform, and typically not because the subject of the fandom wants it. It\'s highly unlikely that there won\'t be a leaked screenshot/clip of a creator asking their fans to harass someone else. More so when the fan base is large.\n\nIf I were to speculate again, I don\'t think LMG needs to auction off lent hardware because they sorely need money.

A modern medium to upper grade fresh food storage unit for your kitchen is NO LONGER a refrigerator  it is now a COMPUTER, designed so one of its\' functions is to keep your food cold.\nDon\'t expect these computers to last 30 years. Well, the computer might. But the cooling system, that\'s another story. Just because you paid $2500 to $3500 doesn\'t mean it\'s going to last ONE DAY past the one year manufacturers warranty. I\'d say the average unit today will give you 7 years without an expensive, if not catastrophic failure. If you get ten years out of one, hang on to it !!! There are a few models that are (by chance) well designed and balanced quite well and are achieving lifespans that the rest of the field envy. I know of a couple SAMSUNG designs that have only one small component that will fail, and can be ELIMINATED with a wire nut and forgotten. Good luck finding a technician that understands this, has experienced it, and will be honest enough to explain the repair and charge you just enough so that he makes a buck or two and you don\'t feel ripped off. Even if your bill was $500 you would still be money ahead, for sure. Especially if, while he/she had the experience and wherewithall to do a slight defrost drain modification for that compartment while it was disassembled. Now, for sure, most techs I\'ve encountered have no idea what I\'m speaking of, sadly, and don\'t have the authorization, company policy, or courage to think outside the box that\'s required for these quite effective repairs. Sad. Aside from the inherent defrost drain problems the manufactures might now have corrected, these units really keep on kicking. Quite accurately, and extremely efficiently.\nNow, in defense of the ""explosive\' refrigerant used in more and more domestic units, don\'t be afraid. It is purified butane, sure it is, but like he said, the charge is only 1.5 to 3.5 liquid ounces. At the top end that\'s about 50 bic lighters, roughly. Believe me, it would be nearly impossible, even if you knew what you were doing and tried, to cause a fire without obvious evidence of the ridiculous effort put forth to do so. Furthermore, butane is not only cheap,  it is BY FAR THE MOST EFFICIENT REFRIGERANT EVER USED in the history of refrigeration. The chemicals that Du Pont developed and made $BILLIONS from, and now the field of refrigerants is more of a forest, were unnecessary for the most part, and totally unnecessary for domestic refrigerator freezer unit s since mechanical refrigerators were invented. AND-- get this- the electrical requirements, or power consumption, is roughly ONE THIRD the power required to use the chemical refrigerants, to produce the same amount of cooling. That stuff is QUICK I\'m telling ya!! Do I have it in my own refrigerator? Come onnn now, of course I do, all 2.78 ounces of the stuff. And I sleep peacefully in the full knowledge regarding it\'s safety. And butane is very low on the greenhouse gas list of culprits. So all these decades and decades of billions of refrigerators running could have been using , say, 60% less energy. That is one HELLUVALOT of electricity. Think about it.\nSo there. I rest my case.\nOh WAIT!!- That story regarding the oil in the compressor and blah-blah-blah is total nonsense in any modern unit.

One thing I didn't touch on here was the power draw of the contactor itself. For the contactors I'm showing here it's quite small (just a few watts) but there are some applications where a latching contactor may be desired. These have two magnets - one to close the contactor, and another to release it. These can save some energy, but come with the risk that a control system failure may leave the contactor engaged. Depending on the application, that could be _very bad_ so they're far less common."", ""It's almost the antithesis to this video, but manual star/triangle motor start switches are so satisfying to use.

It's not a lot of damage per event, but the multiple events happening so quickly would 'age' both the motor and contactor rapidly, increasing the chances for the unit to fail before the next scheduled maintenance inspection, and can we have a show of hands of people who WANT their AC to cut out right when its needed?\n\n(...)\n\nThat's what I thought.

In Household wiring, the practice is to only break power on the \'Hot\' (ungrounded) leg. That way, if the device is only two wire (Hot-Neutral) instead of three wire (Hot-Neutral-Ground), the device still has a ground connection when unpowered.\n\nIndustrial equipment typically works on three-phase power with no neutral (Hot-Hot-Hot) and the ground either provided by a fourth conductor, or else the machine is grounded by a copper rod driven through the floor next to the machine.

My posts highlight the negative consequences of a hyper-technological world on the human condition. Looking at the current state of the world it is safe to say that in the future, it is possible that certain aspects of the human experience could be diminished or altered, potentially resulting in a loss of some elements we consider integral to our societies. There are a few potential ways in which the human aspect of society could be affected in a Cyberpunk future. For example, in a highly technologized and corporate-dominated world, there may be a risk of dehumanization, where people are reduced to mere cogs in the machinery of society. Human interaction, empathy, and compassion may be diminished as individuals become more isolated and detached from one another. Another example is stratification and inequality. There would be this vast gap between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses. This socioeconomic disparity could exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to a loss of social cohesion and solidarity. Also we can already see the loss of privacy and autonomy. Advanced surveillance technologies and pervasive connectivity could further erode personal privacy and individual autonomy. Constant monitoring and data collection might make it challenging to maintain personal agency and freedom of thought. Also the dependency on technology. While technological advancements can enhance our lives, an excessive reliance on technology may lead to a loss of self-sufficiency and critical thinking skills. If technology becomes integral to every aspect of life, society might become vulnerable to disruption and control by those who control the technology. As well as cultural homogenization, In a Cyberpunk-like future, corporate influence would dominate cultural expression, potentially resulting in the loss of diversity and individuality. This could lead to a more homogeneous society, devoid of the rich tapestry of human cultural experiences. But, we need to realize that the future is not predetermined, and societies are shaped by the choices we make collectively. While there are concerns about the potential loss of the human aspect of society, it's a cautionary tale rather than an inevitable outcome.

It’s stupid. F*ck this system. They only care about whatever benefits them. They don’t care about the people. AI has made many people’s lives easier and probably made a lot more people happy than these government policies. Over 90% of people in Cali are working 9-5, and over 70% are most likely barely making it. They worry so much about AI, but what about the border, drugs, and homelessness crisis? What about the ongoing crimes, mass shootings, riots, robberies, and thieves stealing from small businesses? Why aren’t any of these being addressed? Because it AIN’T benefitting the governments or the industries to address such issues. This is the same reason why they want to ban TIKTOK. Tracking??

There is no doubt that all walks of life need it. Accurately introduce automated manufacturing, lead Taiwan for 50 years, and enter extraterrestrial civilization. The first stage of human technology and industrial revolution. In the future, mobile phones will no longer exist, and projection audio ip will be everywhere. For example, will you be using the radio or your current cell phone? In the future, PCs and tablets will cease to exist, and knowledge will enter the cloud. It was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Food, clothing, housing and transportation all require artificial intelligence. Don't doubt that people's hearts are in Taiwan. Artificial intelligence, the global supply chain, is irreplaceable and unique. It is also the core of the global alliance of high-tech countries. AI is our food, clothing, housing, and transportation. All walks of life will use it. AI is not a replacement for humans, but an auxiliary tool for humans in the evolution of the industrial revolution. It will be used by humans all over the world, and the security is very high. , the security and effectiveness of technology are very high. In the future, humans must supervise reasonably, strengthen prevention, and prevent virus intrusion. The error rate of computers is very low. Therefore, supervision, management, and use of AI are the future work of human beings. People's hearts are more terrible than viruses. , don’t doubt that human beings are the saboteurs and hackers. Multi-level security calculations, lock codes, and effective system management are the perfect users of AI. AI will make the future industry intelligent, and complete various tasks efficiently and quickly. It is the best tool that can be quickly applied in all walks of life. If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tool. I believe everyone knows that AI will lead mankind into a new industrial revolution and a new era. It is irresistible.

The baby will be a God. \n\nThere\'s to much evidence that states we were the ""mythical gods"" who went though extension 6 times and forgit who we were, or to believe in us. The bible clearly says we are all Gods children. All created equal. \n\nIt’s not blaspmy if it’s the same way Mary did it through Gods blessing. Only God can give you a God. Ask God, to give you a God. And have faith in your God! All it takes is faith and love. God starts in the womb. The bible clearly says it.\n\nGod is the creator of life. Science is the study of it. If you can\'t find God in science it\'s because the DEVIL is in it and he lied to us about who we were and stole our power to create hell on earth. Our science department isn’t studying life. It’s purposely breaking the 12 laws of the universe with intent off mass extinction over power. We are made of chemical energy around mass. We don’t need technology that purposely broke universal laws to get. It’s mass extinction. And highly dangerous because we are made of energy. They don’t even call it science. They call it physics to try and trick us. Instead helping humanity they are manipulating everyone by breaking the 12 laws of the on purpose over GREED, your DEVIL is in science and HIGHLY DANGEROUS. SHUT DOWN SCIENCE FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE PROCESS AND LAWS OF SCIENCE AND PLOTTING MASS EXTINCTION AND TRYING TO UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH. \n\nSHUT SCIENCE DOWN. SAVE OURSELVES FROM HELL. SCIENCE IS THE END OF LIFE NOT THE STUDY OF IT\n\nPlease research the 12 universal laws and then look at how science is purposefully not following the process and bragging about  breaking the law. I go to jail for breaking laws. Science is obviously the root of EVIL and trying to kill us all.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MqG8OPRyzd4', 'If it were lies then why I see that girl horrible couple years ago', 'How my eyes were weak in 2016', 'Lock it up lock it up.', 'Ai Jobloss is coming fast.

Im out.', 'Does anyone know what paper Marc refers to at 10:04 ? @lexfridman?', ""Now as I know the views of Marc Andreessen, Bill Gates doesn't seem so bad."", 'where is that book list coming from?', 'I would have like to hear Marc talk more about the direct impact of Corps rolling out AI to replace human labor rather than a generalized discussion on how better jobs will inevitably be created. Ultimately, better (i.e. less labor intensive), jobs will be created but for less people, which has drastic human implications. Much of this feels like apologist arguments from a beneficiary of this tech wealth.', 'Not impressed with Marc.  Way under estimates AI.', ""When EVERYONE has an AI assistant to prepare for a job interview, the gains wash out. It's like if everyone gets a college degree, it's no longer special. The income gains from having a degree were almost entirely signaling and not about what you learned in the degree. It was for economic sorting, not for training. Now that everyone has a degree, you have to have a PhD. And everyone has to spend longer in schooling for no real income benefit overall. We already train too many scientists. Science is a terrible career. We don't need more people succeeding in college at all. We're already way over training people for the work they do."", ""People talk like it was obvious back then that communism didn't work. But back then, there was no reason to be so sure. There was a real question whether or not it was gonna overtake capitalism in output. There was a lot of debate about it, and capitalism was by no means the obvious winner. The Soviets did achieve things, and not just being first in space. There are many things. For instance, the USSR built the world's first nuclear power station to generate electricity for a power grid. OK—I hear you—they did shovel unfathomable human misery into it, but western capitalism was nervous for a while. And remember, of all countries on Earth, the communist USSR was the only other superpower."", 'I like the quote about media at 2:40', 'I really liked this one. Never listened to him but he is very knowledgeable.  I wish he could talk slower though.', 'I have probably said this before (as if anyone gives a shit) the best Lex Fridman interviews are obvious on topics I care about (filter 1) and a speaker that doesn\'t put me to sleep (filter 2) and ones that make me think (the only objective). This guy is great. He has a grasp of absolute reality or consciousness as in ""everything new contains everything old"" but he also has an eye on the possible futures.\n\nI feel like Lex is trying to embrace the idea that Capitalism will someday drive a coming Utopia of sorts. Which might be true if your idea of utopia is having a computer for everything, a room to play whatever you want in, in a megastructure where they have to pump in filtered air and water with an EV transit system to your domed agriculture areas where they grow veggies and meat.\n\nAnd I bet this guy realizes that\'s where we are going.\n\nThe future\'s so bright you gotta wear shades..... bio suit.....and radiation badge.\n\nEdit: listened longer. I was wrong. This guy seems to think Economic Growth is the objective or the driver. It certainly is the driver. Then talks about Prohibition, which made illegal liquor worth more, created a malicious economy (my words) and he doesnt seem to see there is no distinction between addicting the world to money, technology, and every company pushing the price as gigh as possible, blocking new products and locking up markets legally, is any different than supporting organized crime and all its nastiness', 'The Netscape Dude.  WOW.', 'Great interview!', 'Amazing interview. So many great insights about humans, provided with large dose of humour. Thank you for this interview. A true treasure.', '🎉🎉🎉', 'And a couple of hours ago i was just sitting here thinking HTML is the best motor for graphic users interfaces. \n\nthis man and his generation rocks!', 'AI is not ML unless you assume I cannot exist without L.  I don\'t think I have a preference toward an assumption right now, but I wouldn\'t suggest that I know that.  I realize it makes it harder to define things, but that\'s kind of the point.\n\nI\'m not sure how many people talk about the concern over GPU\'s, but the only reason I know of that caused them to have hardware that is proficient in AI usage is for ray traced lighting using simpler matrix math.  Maybe that is hardware direction that cannot be avoided due to it\'s benefits elsewhere, but hardware production restrictions contingent on reducing or rather slowing large model growth might be reasonable.\n\nThe problem I\'ve seen is that on a per parameter/input basis, we still don\'t seem to even understand the simplest models and that\'s what gets me.  Is it as ""hard"" to understand as it appears to be or is a matter of not enough people caring due to it not being profitable?\n\nMarc is no doubt a knowledgeable dude, but I don\'t think he understands that of course most models are ""wrong"", that\'s quite literally what empirical science is, and you don\'t get the privilege of knowing you were wrong until the event you were trying to predict already happened.  It\'s not even clear what point he is trying to make regarding Covid as if it didn\'t affect anyone.  I agree on his points regarding eccentric view points, but his just leans in another direction as oppose to a more balanced approach to uncertainty.  He is the guy who you turn to when shit goes wrong and says ""oops"".  And then when you ask him for a model to adjust as a result he doesn\'t have one because he is actually just afraid of being wrong, or so it appears, because the way he discusses what ""science"" actually is appears to be in counter to what it actually is, especially with regard to how you act upon things you do know, and things you do not know.  If from that you concluded that you do not necessarily know how to act simply from information produced by science, you are one step closer to understanding what science even is.  Same thing is always though, it\'s how people understand and handle uncertainty.\n\nI also don\'t know why he thinks all models were wrong, the CDC and WHO were saying wildly different things at the time and if your economy is so fragile and lacking in surplus that an event like that can disrupt it, then maybe you a very different set of problems on your hands than you think you do.  Now he is suggesting models aren\'t part of science?  Marc, the very basis of how the world works in your own head is a model.  I also have to question if this man has ever had a real job in his life, because models run our world.  I am perfectly fine with the idea of questioning them and pointing out where they are wrong, but when you do that, if you cannot provide something better you do have to acknowledge you have reached your own personal limit in what you can provide in that situation.\n\nWhat bothers me is that Marc does not appear to be more knowledgeable in magnitude than the magnitude of monetary worth attributed to him.  It\'s easier to believe the opposite, because then other people can just solve all the problems, but if anything Covid is a demonstration of just how wrong that is.  This isn\'t his ""fault"" either, which is what makes it more difficult.  This isn\'t just some redistribution problem either, rather the value just isn\'t there to begin with.\n\nMarc, in case it wasn\'t obvious, ML is a model.  I don\'t think your cautionary assertions towards models being wrong are that much different than the caution expressed over ML.  If your whole point is that humans are bad at predicting complex systems then that\'s the entire basis of the concern.  I don\'t think data centers should be blown up either (what does that even do? if you want to Dark Age everyone you have to full commit lol, otherwise you are just guessing at area/information control) , but pretending like regulation is automatically wrong and not nuanced is just lying to ourselves.  Society\'s regulation are part of it\'s culture, and if you want a culture of handling uncertainty better, you need to sit down and do a big ol\'think about how exactly something like that would come to be.  You need to .... model it.  Likewise, there is a big difference between regulating the usage of something and outright banning it.\n\nIf you can\'t come up with a way to do that and money doesn\'t magically make it happen, then I have to say I\'m mostly out of ideas as well ; although my guess is that such a trend would start like most trends do.  Word of mouth.  If we spend more time discussing risk and uncertainty than we do discussing what we think we know, maybe that\'s a step in that direction?\n\nI have to say, despite disagreeing with Marc\'s opinions, he comes across as someone who is hard not to like, because I feel like his heart\'s in the right place, but he patently does not understand what science is, seems to understand we do not understand how models work which is great, and has appeared to summarize the alignment problem as a non-issue because the AI told him so, which in the context of the previous statement is deeply confusing.\n\n""If they are smart enough to be scary, how are they not smart enough to be wise.""   ....so, humans?  Except, it\'s not necessarily a human, it\'s an aberration of a combined knowledge where it isn\'t necessarily a summation, subtraction, derivative...we just don\'t know.  It\'s like every time he gets close to the point it just barely eludes him.\n\nCredit where credit is due, Marc knows his nuke history and I\'m sure he fully well knows AI is not that, yet, he seems to want it to fit the same scenario of demonstrating a problem in order to understand that.  I like that outcome, it\'s the easy one.\n\nHyper-productivity does not mean you produce anything useful let alone noticible.', ""I'm always in awe of folks who can talk at this speed, there must be so much computing power going on in their big brain head"", 'Why is capitalism and all technology around the world is driving down the price of healthcare, houses and college fees?\n\nI am often surprised by how much we have regressed in above areas despite of so much advances in technology.', 'Wish my Ryzen 5 processed as fast as Marc speaks.', ""If AI model makers ingest prior conversation into future results, isn't it going to start leaking potentially sensitive information from that user session.  Naturally the training will contain all user identifiable browser info and related data. \n\nFuture prompts could leak to other public users in addition to the ai operator, linked with other web data.\nCould explain some browser fingerprinting I see blocked in my firewall."", 'Its impossible to listen to this on x2', 'Marc is exccedingly impressive, which gives me pause.  When he speaks about a subject  about which I am informed, he appears dogmatic to me  and somewhat superficial.  Nevertheless, he is provocative, stimulating, and well worth listening to.', 'The espionage was not decisive in the Soviets developing an atomic bomb.  This, I think, is the current concensus view of historians.  That is,, the Soviets may have not been there is 1949, but would have developed it shortly thereafter even without the espionage.  India, France, Pakistan, Israel, etc. all managed the deed.  What the Manhatten Project produced was mostly an engineering tour de force,  not an original scientific scientific one.', 'I didn´t think such ""capitalism is good communism is evil"" dinosaurs still existed? 🤔', 'Thanks for this.

It is a slippery slope to conflate the two concepts, that many people talking about the subject of AI fall into. \nI get it. It's a deeply attractive philosophical talking point. But there are many more near dangers and practical implications for what we have right now that warrant more of our thinking space than hypothetical Hollywood inspired science fiction.

I would argue that the same logic can be applied to Marc Andreessen: the fact that he is a legendary [software engineer and entrepreneur and VC] doesn't make him more qualified on commenting AI social risks than the AI insiders (e.g. Geoffery Hinton) and futurist(e.g. Bostrom).

Your questioning of Steve's motives also raises questions about your impartiality. While you highlight the importance of evidence-based conclusions, your analysis seems to selectively challenge specific claims while not addressing others with the same rigor. This approach detracts from the balanced assessment that one would expect from an impartial breakdown.\n\nMoreover, your focus on Steve's presentation style and your apparent alignment with certain media outlets' strategies further accentuates the perception of bias. While your dedication to evidence and data-driven conclusions is laudable, it's unfortunate that these biases have the potential to overshadow what could have been a genuinely objective exploration of the subject.

I\'m also not particularly fond of his style of reporting, simply for many of the same reasons you comment on, so I can greatly appreciate how you explained them much better than I do.\n\nOverall, I do find it rather hypocritical seeing GN going after LTT, especially for some of the more minor issues.

Ian has been around for a long time, he knows the  tech world is huge, ever changing, very much specialization, no one can call themself the epitome of knowledge, no one should use such self-proclamation as a base  to belittle the rest of the community. It is toxic and telling, you cannot hide such reality by implying otherwise. Time to stop bathing in such cult of personality snarkyness. Now before GN fanbase cries but LTT started it first, come on, the comments you keep replaying, is only offensive if looking through the dogmatic lens of ego.', ""This is dissapointing from Dr. Cutress. I expected better but he seems very biased towards saving LMG's ass, and he chooses to have talked to LMG but not with GN before this video."", 'I’ve said it before, but I’m glad to hear you share some similar opinions. I think all of this has shed light that Linus and LTT are very much in the wrong on a lot of this. However, Steve is no Robin Hood. His mocking, smugness, and laughing at other’s misfortune, as well as his arrogance is appalling. He is very much a bully who benefits off watching others suffer - and even seems to enjoy it. If he were truly as neutral as he states, he would be an amazing asset for the community. Instead, however, I find him appalling. He says the right things, but completely in the wrong way, and by the wrong means, and with a significant dose of hypocrisy.', 'Thank you for this, content! Well explained and well said.', ""I enjoyed the video and found it very accurate to the points I have tried to make on other forums, but more articulate.  I do have a little contention, the assumption of allegation to be true before the facts are reviewed is also the exact same as assuming someone else's guilt before the facts come out.  Therefore, it is very important to not only hear both sides of the story but to see the actual evidence before assuming anything to be true.  That's not to say that she's not to be taken seriously, or that LMG or LTT should not go through the process of verifying and investigating those claims.  There is a difference between being sympathetic to the victim and being a fool and creating a new victim by not doing the proper fact finding necessary."", '19:10 that\'s a very uncharitable take on the community\'s expectations. Time and again Linus has highlighted the importance of ethics, but when it comes to follow his own words, he fails miserably.  And even when accepting responsibility, he chooses to be dismissive. The most flippant comment he made during his apology was to dismiss Luke\'s statement that he should stop Linus doing stupid things more effectively with ""and he [Luke] will fail"". This is incredibly egotistical, and unprofessional. No one wants to throw tomatoes, people just want a sincere heartfelt apology. If he can\'t offer that, he should stay quiet instead of offering a non-apology.', 'Correction, people that don\'t just blindly believe accusers are not f#$!"" idiots, they might just believe in that little old thing called due process of law.

It's closest to where i stand, with a general agreement on GN's points, real concern on how the billet labs incident happened, extreme concern on the Maddison claims, and a general dissatisfaction with how GN went about all of this. While i do very much appreciate GN's work on keeping players in the industry honest, I've had issues for a while with how self-rightous their content feels at times, and the reasons behind that feeling were quite well explained here (even the ones i might not have been able to pinpoint and/or articulate myself). \n\nAll in all, i hope that all parties will take the criticism they are receiving here and improve because of it, and that the tech content space will be a better place for it."", 'Trying to defend a corporation that is not even remorseful nor sincere in admitting its mistake is pointless.

Releasing the GN LTT video shortly after the Linus tech lab guys were flexing about their review quality and being followed by a video of GNs own 250k upgrade towards increasing reviewing standards felt especially awkward. Content creators will always battle each other for watch time and impressions, as viewers attention is inherently finite. Pumping out content asap seems to have been a big advantage for LTT considering their channel popularity.

Therefore, they ought to do more to ensure accuracy and knowing this, but ignoring it as LTT seems to do, Steve’s conclusion is a malicious carelessness.

He tends to nitpick in all his work, and he harps on them and tend to speculate on the motives behind those errors. \nSpeculating on motives is impossible. We are not psychologists," we haven't had deep analysis and evaluation of the persons or have done a full company review. It is speculation and only reveals the critics biases."""""," """"I agree with the language Steve used", he did come to a conclusion before presenting a fact.\r\n\r\n1:11:00 I disagree about the asterisk editing to fix an error.  The example shown, it was shown on screen for a second with the correct video card model.  That is not a proper way in my opinion for when an error is spotted, for how to fix it.  Whenever I see those, I have to then pause the video, rewind it, and then pause it to read what the graphic had.  Steve also said a voice over with the fix would be fine where someone could record a voice over clip at an editor's workstation, that is then integrated into the video before it is uploaded.  That is what Steve meant for it being 5 minutes.  Not reshooting that part of the video.\r\n\r\n1:26:00 I disagree.  If they notice an error in the video after uploading, they can take set it to private, upload a replacement one in its place since LMG has access to that special feature, and then set the video back to public once youtube indicates the replacement has finished being processed.\r\n\r\nAs for different kinds of content, some are more serious, while others are just for entertainment.  LMG tries to be technical, but also entertaining.  So their reviews should be accurate.  And while errors do happen, they need to be responded to.  So when an error happens, previously their response was not enough.  I do think that someone claiming that it's just entertainment is trying to rationalize the error shown in the video as a way to dismiss it.\r\n\r\nAnd claiming that some viewers would base their purchase on it is a valid thing to say.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion," Linus had talked about how labs was going to allow for better testing.  Yet how they handled errors when caught was done poorly.  It's how a company responds to a mistake is how you should be judging that company.  Every company makes mistakes.""""", 'Tbh the whole thing is quite strange. No matter people\'s views on either side (because LMG clearly need to tighten up operations), to do what essentially amounts to a public takedown of a rival is a very hostile move from a business standpoint," and it\'s as if GN is taking the seemingly righteous stance of some sort of whilsblower. This """"We\'re just doing what needs to be done"""" type mentality. But", we\'re it not for the labs video in which which LMG staff incorrectly spoke and mentioned Hardware Unboxed and GN, I don\'t know if this video would have ever been made. It\'s clear that was viewed as some degree of provocation, and Steve even states that they decided to let it slide on that occasion, but clearly not, because they chose to revisit the topic.\n\nWhen you operate in a public space, you know full well that the posting of a video like that has serious fall out, and If I put myself in the shoes on GN, I can\'t help but feel, at the bare minimum," I would reach out and say """"We\'ve seen these patterns emerging and are concerned. We wanted to bring it to your attention before we\'re prompted to report on it"""". \n\nAnd I\'ve seen a few times the notion that LMG should almost be grateful", or that they should consider it an intervention, but at least from a business perspective, it would very difficult to view GN\'s actions not as a competitive attack. Even with them not monetizing their video, their profile will have significantly benefitted from it. And whilst I don\'t think it was some sort of move to eliminate a competitor from the space, I think anyone that believes you go about making a video like this without some sort of emotional motive is probably fooling themselves a bit. Honestly, at least from a business perspective, the lesson learned will almost certainly be to tighten up operations, and that competitors should be viewed as such," and not to be """"pally pally"""" with them.\n\nThere is literally no other market I can think of where doing what GN has done to a competitor would be considered acceptable practice", and tbh, I don\'t really like the tone it sets forward. Apply it to any other market and it seems Ludacris. Picture a world in which an independent shoe manufacturer runs an expose on another, but then tells you it\'s merely an intervention for the good of the shoe market and that they don\'t benefit from it. It\'s a very odd thing to do, no matter your thoughts on LMG.', 'Welcome to Intel Penang!', 'Wow, this video and his arguments are bad! Sorry to say that, but most of the arguments are a prime example for a straw man argument, not to mention the times he contradicts himself in this video.', 'With Bilelt labs thing.

Not sure why the comment about how Steve is partially motivated by money or something and that\'s why he did it? Just because one brings up a bigger company, doesn\'t mean they wanted to just for exposure, Steve\'s character doesn\'t follow the argument you are trying to make with your statement, it only reminds us on why you decided to bring up this video...basically to get in on the action right? a ""slice"" of that good money from this \'drama\' lol.

Billet Labs confirmed via email (and there are screenshots of those emails in the LTT apology video), that they sent LTT the Monoblock for LTT to keep so they could use it in future builds if they wanted. That's an important piece to the puzzle, because that invalidates the claims that LTT never had any permission to take or use the monoblock afterwards. (Effectively stealing it) No, they shouldn't have auctioned it, but the timeline of events with that small detail is pretty easy to explain. BL gives LTT the monoblock to test and use for future builds, etc. They catalog it as inventory. BL emails back after the review shitting on them and says on second thought, do you mind give it back to us? LTT says yes, but they fail to pull it out of their inventory (Because they are disorganized), and whomever picked the parts for the auction selected that part. \n\nSo there’s two possibilities:\r\n\r\nSteve knew Billet initially told LTT to keep it, and he chose to leave it out because it wasn’t part of the narrative he was trying to present.\r\n\r\nSteve didn’t know, because Billet didn’t tell him — and Steve chose to publish his video without asking LTT for comment, just taking Billet’s word for everything.\r\n\r\nBoth possibilities are equally bad. He was either intentionally deceptive, or unintentionally deceptive.\n\n\nTheres one more piece: Apparently BL told LTT that the monoblock WAS compatible with the 4090 (As in it would mount, but couldnt verify how well it would perform), yet told Steve they stated it SHOULD be compatible. It was only after the review came out did BL try a 4090 and realize it did not fit. If BL indeed told LTT it would work with the 4090, then it's on them for the shitty review, regardless of the GPU they sent with it. If I buy an AM4 cooler and the manufacturer states it is compatible with my AM5 system, and then doesn't fit, is that my fault?"", ""I don't think it's fair/ethical to accept a product from a company to review if you've already made up your mind ahead of time that you'll ultimately tell people not to buy it because you feel like its price point is too high."", 'Sexist comments?

Youre calling it shade to suit your narrative. What on earth is this Kristopher guy on about.', 'My personal take on the issues with LMG as it stands these days is that it has gone from a tech enthusiast thing to Big Corporation(tm). And the main problem with Big Corporation, in general is that money gets to be the main thing. So things like spending 100, 200 ... 500 dollars on a correctly done review is not done in favor of a few jokes and good video editing. It goes from something useful to something entertaining. \n\nLMG is on a whole pretty good. But it produces a lot of - again, to me fill out entertainment material. It sort of looses the root thing that made LTT good.

85,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0YW7x9U5TQ,Electric cars prove we need to rethink brake lights,2832951,124052,16352,Technology Connections,0,"['GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE!

We are still leaving too much up to manufacturers right now.', 'i’m so confused what your talking about. are you upset the brake light on a car won’t turn on unless your pressing the brake? 13 seconds 0-60 isn’t that fast', ""I've been thinking of the same issue... I'm driving a car with Auto Cruise Control, and I tried using it in jams during peak hours. The function works perfectly, but I couldn't figure out if my brake lights are illuminating when the car slows down automatically due to traffic in front. Would be nice if someone could test this out as well so I could know if I should use this function in the future or not..."", 'I wonder if you’re aware that these cars also engage the brake lights constantly anytime the car is going even slightly downhill with the cruise control engaged? People are reporting that even after the new brake light software update that just came out this ridiculous issue still exists.  The car is not slowing down whatsoever but the brake lights stay on constantly. I hope you’ll do another video showing this after the updates and maybe it will stir Hyundai to action again. Thanks for all the great videos that you post.', 'As usual, GREAT critique, my friend!  And I know this may be slightly off topic, but if anyone is going to get hot under the collar about this DANGEROUS fail, I know you will.  It\'s the function you mention in this review -- the Auto Assist Cruse Control.  I have this on my 2018 Honda Civic and I understand that it is a now a common function on most all cars since the last 10 years.  When engaged, it will allow the car to cruse at a speed that you set, but it will also sense the speed of the car in front of you and it will adjust your car\'s speed to that car all the way down to a full stop should that car stop.  It will also  sense if an object of any kind moves into your car\'s path.  That all works just fine...until it doesn\'t.  No question It is quite an advantage, especially when you are driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic for long periods of time.  It takes the stress out of having to focus intently on what the car in front of you is doing - BUT here\'s a VERY SERIOUS FLAW, much more of a potential hazard that your break light issue.  \n\nIn my Civic, I can be driving along for a long time, just for laughs, let\'s say an hour with the AACC engaged.  The car has been faithfully watching the car in front of me and slowing down when it slows down, stopping when it stops and going again when it starts to move again.  I am lured into total confidence that my car will stop when necessary and it will...IF, that is, I didn\'t inadvertently step on the brake, even for an instant, during that hour because if you even just tap that brake peddle for a second, the AACC will disengage completely and your car will NO LONGER follow the car in front to a full stop, au contraire mon fraire, it WONT STOP; it will just keep on cruising...RIGHT INTO the car in front of you!  So how come I don\'t realize the Auto Assist Cruise Control is OFF?  Well be cause the Honda engineers did not give me any substantial indication that the AACC has turned off. I am still driving oblivious to that changed condition, thinking it is still on and protecting me from a collision.   \n\nTERRIBLE HUMAN INTERFACE -- The indicator for the AACC function is a small little icon in the upper right hand corner of the dash.  When it is ON, that minuscule icon shows a small number, like say 55, meaning the cruse control speed is set at 55mph and it will keep the car moving at 55 miles per hour unless a car in front of it slows down.  When you stip on the brake and the AACC turns off, the only indicaton that that has happened, is the 55 changes to OFF.  And get this -- the position of the AACC icon not only is very small, it is placed where t can easily be totally obscured by the steering wheel, depending on your height.  And even if you do see it, it is so easy not be aware that it has changed and is indicating that your car now wants to keep driving at whatever speed it\'s going at and it WON\'T STOP no matter if that car in front of you has come to a total stop, YOUR car will plow right into its rear.  \n\nI contend that if a mechanism that will prevent my car from crashing into anything in front of it be switched from ON to OFF,  there should be some indication should be happening that is obvious and insistent and demanding and a lot more dramatic than a little 10 point text in the corner of the dash changing from 55 to OFF.  I say , the whole damn dash should flash red and a loud audible alert should sound to let me know that I now have control of the car and I better pay attention and  brake when necessary, because my car isn\'t going to do it for me!  \n\nI have spoken to friends who own both American cars and imports and they all have this same flaw -- the feedback to the driver that the AACC has switched off is almost non-existent, and THAT, I must say, is potentially even more dangerous than brake lights not functioning as expected.  And putting potential injury aside, even from a fault issue, a brake light fail on a Ecar will cause the car behind you to possibly crash into you -- THEIR fault; the AACC fail on any car and YOU will crash into the car in front of you -- YOUR fault. \n\nAnd here\'s the thing, the Honda designers already are aware of what to do to get the driver\'s attention on this kind of auto functionally; for example, the Lane Assist function -- when that function is turned ON, allowing the car\'s sensors to keep the car centered in the lane, if you take your hands off the wheel for more than 10 seconds, a big yellow bar flashes across the FULL dash with the words in bold 34 point text: DRIVING REQUIRED, plus a loud rapid beeping sound.  The SAME thing should happen if you just tap the brake while driving with AACC engaged -- that same level of warning feedback should happen to let you know, you\'ve just set your car to hurl itself into anything that\'s in front at whatever speed you\'ve set it to ""cruise"" at.  I\'m just sayin...', ""go on an older car with those 3 separated taillights and lift your foot off the accelerator. it's the same shit and you can't solve it mechanically, only by a software, because both have engine braking"", 'Careful with your recall request.  Manufacturer might take cheapest solution and simply wire brake lights *ON* all the time if there is no minimum deceleration requirement.  ;)', 'The solution is very simple.\nWhen you lift partially off the accelerator and regen braking kicks in there should be a sensor to detect even light regen braking to illuminate the brake light. Also when regen is active the brake light would flash, and the more aggressive the braking is, the faster the brake light flashes. When the friction brakes start engaging the flashing stops and the brake lights go solid red.\nEasy peasy...', 'Your video is good and Funny a little bit boring though', ""I have an electric car from 1998, it is a Solectria Force (built off of a Chevy Metro chassis) and this car has a calibration parameter in the motor controller for how much regen torque should result in brake light illumination.  The early EV conversions didn't mix pedals with fancy brake blending so they put a bunch of regen into the accelerator pedal which allows the one pedal driving you refer to.  So, I was always happy with the brake light trigger point when driving this car... until, I finally updated it from lead acid batteries to lithium ion, with the drastically reduced weight, the car would decelerate quickly without illuminating the brake light.  I found an old PC laptop, loaded up the windows 98 app for RS485 telnet and calibration, adjusted the setting, and was good again.  I cut the current/torque setting in half, and it was perfect."", 'anyone else notice he was going 60 in a 55 and recorded it? .lol wounder if he got a ticket in the mail..', 'When I was a UK ""WHICH"" magazine subscriber, I raised the issue of electric regenerative braking not lighting the brake lights after a near miss I saw. Which are looking into this. Its not just the ionic as the Nissan Leaf also has one pedal drive mode. Just one point though my accelerator pedal in my diesel does work on a cable, not electric key.', 'Engine/ exhaust braking has this same flaw, just not as exaggerated', 'Engine braking already had this problem, and not only with stick shifts!', 'I think an accelerometer based system is actually a great solution that should be applied to cars of all types. It detects all kinds of deceleration with one system.

You\'re doing 65 in a truck, possibly towing something.  Do you mash the brakes? Because you need to- that car in front of you is almost stopped, while you\'re barreling at it, due to meet its rear end in less than 30 seconds.  That car is slowing to make a hard right onto a small or even dirt road.  Even if that car has been slowing down quite gently to maybe 5mph to make that tight turn onto a rutted road, it\'s hard to tell how quickly you\'re closing on it.  If its brake lights were on, you\'d instantly know ""this guy might be going real slowly, I need to pay attention"".  If there are no brake lights, it\'s easy to assume the car is going highway speed or accelerating to it.  Meeting a car that can stop without brake lights on a two lane road is a terrifying idea.', ""Honestly, I wish there was a regulation against putting yellow lights on the backs of cars & trucks.  They're needlessly bright and annoying--especially those obnoxious SUVs and pickups that place their brake/turn signal lights way up high at eye level.  When I'm stopped behind one at a traffic light, it fills my whole cabin with strobing yellow light.\n\nYellow lights belong on the front of the vehicle.  Red lights belong on the back.

I always drive with both feet (one on the gas, the other on the brake in an automatic car) because it gives the best reaction times in the event of braking or accelerating. Try going to the drag strip and holding you foot on the brake then switching to the gas when the light turns green vs having a foot ready to push the gas as your other foot lifts off the brake (when the light turns green), it's roughly 0.3 sec difference in reaction time (in my case). I often hear that you shouldn't drive with two feet because you might confuse the petals, I mean this can happen with one foot too (if you can confuse 1 foot to 1 petal, it seems more likely that people would confuse 1 foot with 2 pedals which is why I often see people hit the accelerator instead of the brake when driving with 1 foot). The worst thing I can see happing is you end up riding the brakes because your foot gets tired (usually a cruse control situation)."", ""Seems like an ez fix, just wire the brake lights to the regen as well as the hydraulic system. So that even when the brake isn't pushed but regen comes on the brake lights at the rear indicate the car is slowing."", ""I see your comparing 1 pedal driving with an EV to 2 or even 3 pedal driving with an ICE. The thing is why not compare apples to apples? Like 1 pedal driving in an ICE and 1 pedal driving in an EV. I can slow my ICE car by down shifting (in auto or manual transmissions) or using the handbrake both of witch require 1 Pedal driving (unless manual) and slow the car without putting on the brake light... I honestly get that when a car slows it should put on the brake lights but there's so many ways to slow a car without using the brakes (hills, Jake brake, rolling resistance, air flaps, fans, etc.)"", 'When did amber rear turn lights get phased out? Some cars like the Kona have them super low in the bumper so when your behind them you cant tell they want to turn or change lanes.', ""Honestly, shouldn't need software, if it is a fully electric brake system, put a torsion/tension meter on it that is set to turn the lights on at a set limit. If it is a standard hydraulic setup like most, simply put a pressure meter in line (AT LEAST 2 SIDES, preferably all 4 (requiring 2 to activate)) which are relative cheap and durable (source we use them at work and there are very old ones that get bashed to s**t daily). Either of these solutions should be fairly simple to implement, and these are off the top of my head at 1:28 in the video. I am sure even better options exist that don't require software, I say this as software if great until that computer craps the bed, or has glitch etc. Another possible option (possibly just as a backup/emergency indicator) would be to measure G-forces in a single direction. Pos G (braking) would activate/ Neg G (accelerating) would do nothing or maybe find a clever use for this who knows. \n\nAgain, you might cover these in your video, but I only had about 3 minutes of free time and I chose to use it writing this.

You said, if greater than 0.2g of deceleration is detected turn on brake lights, that\'s simple enough, almost like a simple if-then statement. \n\nIf it was based on throttle position it would need to know how you are braking, were you slowly decelerating, were you slowly accelerating, are you holding constant speed, etc. The car would first need to know initial speed, then how quickly you change speed, simply easing off the accelerator slowly shouldn\'t trigger a brake light, just like in a normal car when you let off the accelerator a bit your brake lights don\'t come on. So the computer would have to constantly calculate differences in velocity and inputs to figure out if the brake lights need to come on... instead of just ""is deceleration greater than 0.2gs? Yes? Turn on lights.""', 'I used to drive a stick shift car and got good at slowing down to a creep only using the clutch and gears rarely using the brake pedal 😅', 'Cell phones cancel brake lights.', 'When I gear down in my car, it will slow down a lot faster then that and no brake lights come on.', '""One pedal driving mode"" should not be a thing, period. That is literally asking for trouble exactly like this. Why is that needed? What does that accomplish? You typically only use one foot to drive (unless you drive a manual in which case you work the clutch with the other foot) so why do you also not want to have dedicated brake and acceleration pedals? Is changing pedals really that hard? \n\nRegardless, induced deceleration should always turn on the brake lights in a software driven light system. If I have told the car to start decelerating those brake lights should come on, of the car is merely going slower because I am not using cruise control and am going up a hill or on flat ground coasting they should not come on because I am not inducing deceleration, that is just friction.\n\nSo no, I fundamentally disagree with the notion we should teach people to NOT USE THEIR BRAKE PEDAL TO SLOW DOWN.

Its actually pretty simple, I’ll try to keep my explanation here as concise as humanly possible:\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is this: As we improve AI, it will get better and better at achieving the goals we give it. Eventually, AI will be powerful enough to tackle most tasks you throw at it. \r\n\r\nBut there’s an inherent problem with this. The AI we have now only cares about achieving its goal in the most efficient way possible. That’s no biggie now, but the moment our AI systems start approaching human level intelligence, it suddenly becomes very dangerous. It’s goals don’t even have to change for this to be the case. I’ll give you a few examples.\r\n\r\nEx 1: Lets say its the year 2030, you have a basic AGI agent program on your computer, and you give it the goal: “Make me money”. You might return the next day & find your savings account has grown by several million dollars. But only after checking it’s activity logs do you realize that the AI acquired all of the money through phishing, stealing, & credit card fraud. It achieved your goal, but not in a way you would have wanted or expected.\r\n\r\nEx 2: Lets say you’re a scientist, and you develop the first powerful AGI Agent. You want to use it for good, so the first goal you give it is “cure cancer”. However, lets say that it turns out that curing cancer is actually impossible. The AI would figure this out, but it still wants to achieve it’s goal. So it might decide that the only way to do this is by killing all humans, because it technically satisfies its goal; no more humans, no more cancer. It will do what you said, and not what you meant.\r\n\r\nThese may seem like silly examples, but both actually illustrate real phenomenon that we are already observing in today’s AI systems. The first scenario is an example of what AI researchers call the “negative side effects problem”. And the second scenario is an example of something called “reward hacking”.\r\n\r\nNow, you’d think that as AI got smarter, it’d become less likely to make these kinds of “mistakes”. However, the opposite is actually true. Smarter AI is actually more likely to exhibit these kinds of behaviors. Because the problem isn’t that it doesn’t understand what you want. It just doesn’t actually care. It only wants to achieve its goal, by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nSo, the question is then: how do we prevent this potentially dangerous behavior? Well, there’s 2 possible methods.\r\n\r\nOption 1: You could try to explicitly tell it everything it can’t do (don’t hurt humans, don’t steal, don’t lie, etc). But remember, it’s a great problem solver. So if you can’t think of literally EVERY SINGLE possibility, it will find loopholes. Could you list every single way an AI could possible disobey or harm you? No, it’s almost impossible to plan for literally everything.\r\n\r\nOption 2: You could try to program it to actually care about what people want, not just reaching it’s goal. In other words, you’d train it to share our values. To align it’s goals and ours. If it actually cared about preserving human lives, obeying the law, etc. then it wouldn’t do things that conflict with those goals.\r\n\r\nThe second solution seems like the obvious one, but the problem is this; we haven’t learned how to do this yet. To achieve this, you would not only have to come up with a basic, universal set of morals that everyone would agree with, but you’d also need to represent those morals in its programming using math (AKA, a utility function). And that’s actually very hard to do.\r\n\r\nThis difficult task of building AI that shares our values is known as the alignment problem. There are people working very hard on solving it, but currently, we’re learning how to make AI powerful much faster than we’re learning how to make it safe.\r\n\r\nSo without solving alignment, everytime we make AI more powerful, we also make it more dangerous. And an unaligned AGI would be very dangerous; give it the wrong goal, and everyone dies. This is the problem we’re facing, in a nutshell.""', ""Greg Brockman sounds just like the nerd who could've developed such a thing 😂 Such a robotic tone and awkward body language... Just Kidding."", ""AI has the potential to end careers, destroy the Arts, increase scamming and help spread disinformation. I get all of the wonderful things that it will also be able to assist with and improve on and achieve. But to have this guy sit there and say that he's leaving his creation up to us to sort out and create guardrails for is frankly terrifying. I'm not sure he's aware that protection laws are always ten steps behind the advancements of technology, so we will never be able to catch up with its progress and people's lives and jobs could be at risk in the future, if not properly regulated. It's definitely not to be taken lightly. I feel like people are living with a false sense of security thinking it will be all hunky dory, but it has the potential to bring real chaos and turmoil if we're not careful too. I know my industry as a Film Composer, which I've spent the best part of my life working towards, with £20,000 of student debts still looming over my head, is at huge risk of going extinct. Certainly lower to mid jobs on the industry scale even some high end jobs too will go in the next two to three years. Music Library Companies will probably be first to go and that's just one example out of hundreds of other job sectors that will be threatened. I mean will there be enough new jobs going round to make up for the high levels of unemployment that AI might end up creating? How does society work when computers are putting humans out of jobs?

Let the public see each iteration as you build it so they can critique, improve, and regulate it. Releasing this technology iteratively over time as you build it, and observing preliminary models working in the real world, does a lot to negate this ""AI singularity"" problem and allow regulators and the public to catch up. \n\nGreg has me convinced that this approach is the more moral approach. Allow AI children to play in the real world so we can watch them and provide feedback on what they do BEFORE they grow up and get out of our control. Don\'t let tech giants build mature AI in secret where their training regimen is essentially pointing super computers at consumers brains and rewarding the computer for convincing the human to buy a product, or spend more time looking at a website.

These early musings were basic, and focused on imitating human-to-human digital interactions. Many years later, I was a partner with IBM, helping to showcase its flagship predictive analytics software, essentially a powerful ""AI"" tool focusing on making reliably accurate predictions using large datasets. For example, IBM\'s ""SPSS Modeler"" works by using training models of known variable values, and uses the power of modern computer processors to compute very large sets of training data in order to predict possible outcomes of similar, new data inputs. As powerful a tool as this tech is, it is ""dumb AI"": that is, it is not capable of genuine reasoning, and can only execute programmed instructions, which makes it only a tool, albeit, a sophisticated and impressive tool. What most uninitiated people do not understand is that basic ""AI"" is not actually ""intelligent"", and is not hard to build. This is what currently exists, impacting virtually every aspect of our modern lives. However, artificial general (and independent) intelligence is the so-called ""holy grail"" of the field of AI, especially data science. We are nowhere near achieving this technology.

Falta de ética jornalística não dar ""direito de resposta"" antes de uma publicação. \nFicou doído com o comentário que um engenheiro aleatório que nem tem treinamento para lidar com público fez enquanto guiava uma visita do pessoal pré LTX 2023.\nA prova maior do desrespeito (eu fiquei furioso quando vi) foi quando ele zoa o Linus depois dele dizer que ""tinha muita experiência com aquilo"". Pelamordedeus, Linus fazendo coisas bizarras é ""parte do show"" (ele mesmo disse alguns WANs shows atrás que ele propositalmente tinha um pensamento não regular para evitar fazer vídeos monótonos... foi acho que 2 WANs shows atrás, quando ele brincou que ia jogar uma garrafa de água na cabeça do Luke), é óbvio que o Linus sabe pra caramba de tecnologia, o cara já montou centenas de PCs ao vivo (já vi ele montando 20 PCs ao vivo de uma vez, em série, para ser usado pela equipe de editores).\n\nA questão central aqui é: o próprio Linus deixou muito claro (para quem se dá ao trabalho de ver os WAN shows) que a empresa ficou grande demais e a vida dele ficou zuada.\n\nAqui as coisas que ele mesmo disse e que mostram que ele estava fazendo o que podia para resolver todos os problemas:\nA) Fez vídeo triste dizendo que ia se aposentar... muitos meses atrás.... disse que não estava com a vida boa, que precisava parar e não aguentava mais.\nB) Desistiu de se aposentar, mas, em troca, se auto-retirou da posição de CEO e contratou profissional (ex-chefe dele).\nC) No WAN show literalmente anterior ao problema todo ele fez um segmento inteiro recebendo sugestões sobre como poderia implementar um sistema de revisão pública de vídeos antes que fossem ao ar. Ele disse claramente que estavam ocorrendo erros, que o pessoal que edita os vídeos não tem formação técnica (são especialistas só em editar vídeos, não sabem nada de PCs) e estavam deixando erros passarem. Ele disse que iria criar um sistema onde um grupo de seguidores poderia ver os vídeos antes da publicação e encontrar erros.\nD) No vídeo do protótipo lá... quem conhece bem o Linus reparou 2 coisas: 1) - Ele não conhecia bem o outro Host... Linus não tinha química nenhuma com o cara, teve uma parte do vídeo em que Linus faz uma piada e o outro Host corta ele e fica um climão ruim... 2) Quem conhece o Linus sabe que ele tava incomodado e queria encerrar aquela gravação o mais rápido possível. Quando ele viu que a placa certa não foi alocada e que teria que regravar ele agiu emocionalmente e cancelou o reteste porque não aguentava mais estar ali gravando com aquela equipe de semi-desconhecidos (e empresa tem 102 pessoas +-).\nE) Linus já tinha reclamado sobre isso diversas vezes em WANs shows: ele sempre reclamava que a empresa estava tão grande que ele não conhecia os próprios funcionários. Ele chegou a dar um exemplo: que ele não sabia para quem ele deveria segurar a porta na hora de entrar na empresa porque não sabia quem caminhando no meio da rua trabalhava lá ou não.', 'Os benchmarks errados quase ""propositalmente"", reviews completamente idiotas, o assédio da madison, até trouxeram a tona o caso do cara que comprou a placa de 1 milhão do NCIX tech tips, lembro que na época todo mundo falou mal, ele ficou dando carteirada e deu no que deu.

Higher signal density made it possible to seamlessly wipe from one shot to the next, far more smoothly.  It also meant that a still frame was a complete frame, everything in place, like looking at a frame of film.  This let you compare, say, 22:33:44 with 22:33:43 to decide which frame you wanted to start with.  This was also the reason for the sound during rewind or fast forward.\n\nBeta was intended as a professional format from the beginning, with consumer sales a nice add-on, while Victor Home System never was.  Put Betamax next to VHS on a bigger TV and the difference was as obvious as comparing NTSC to PAL.  On a 19"", not so much.   Thus, Betamax (original format) was popular for field newsgathering until Betacam came along.  The consumer stuff was only II or III, but even prosumer-level had all three speeds.

It may be due to a recorder difference, or the tape being thicker (and thus presumably having more emulsion, which resuls in a stronger signal at the head, which means less noise), but the undeniable fact is, halving the speed of the tape certainly didn\'t do beta II any favors. Half speed means half bandwidth. They compansated by doubling the head speed...

My memory is that we just used the smaller tapes because all of our shows (mostly video lectures for remote students, but a couple independent shows as well) were under 30 minutes. For a while they had me work as a tape operator on a weekly live show they were doing, which mostly was just recording the episode to tape but also playing back video packages and promos during the broadcast. They wanted a countdown to be ready to switch back to the studio, so I\'d put the playback tape in, fast forward to the last frame of the video (using a big fast forward/rewind knob -- VERY satisfying!), reset the control track to 0:00:00;00, then go back to the beginning of the video (actually a second or two before iirc). The control track is basically the same as timecode except timecode is encoded in each frame of the tape itself and control track is relative and can be reset, so once I\'d reset it to the *end* of the tape, when I rewound to the beginning it would show me a negative number saying exactly how long it was to the end of the video! So I\'d just start reading the numbers off when it got to -0:00:10;00. Fun times!\n\nThey switched to digital video a couple years after I left (early 2010s).

I had also heard that VHS won because the public\'s simplistic view was that ""bigger is better"".\n\nOther than that I have learned that the history of the format war is a lot more complex than I had previously thought and that both VHS and beta have strengths and weaknesses in their media design, player design, marketing and public adoption. Personally the length of the tape was never much concern because most of what we did was rent movies from the video store.\n\nI thought that VHS-SP looked noticeably better than the beta-II quality.

It can play the latest AAA games at high settings or can max out the framerates for the competitive games. \n\nIf you have anything more than a passing interest in gaming, the G15 is the much better choice than an XPS 15. If all you're after is productivity/work oriented use case then I'd save a couple bucks and get an M1 MacBook Air.

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\n38. This is the first and great commandment.\n\n39. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\n40. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\n\n      Matthew 22:37-40\n\n8. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.\n\n           Psalm 34:8\n\n5. Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\n\n6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\n\n7. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.\n\n          Proverbs 3:5-7\n\n21. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\n\n         Matthew 1:21\n\nWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\n\nAnd they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\n\nHe saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?\n\nAnd Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\n\nAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n\nAnd I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n\n          Matthew 16:13-19\n\n16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\n17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\n\n18. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n\n19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\n\n          John 3:16-19\n\nFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n               Romans 6:23\n\n16. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\n\n             Mark 16:16\n\n1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n\n2. The same was in the beginning with God.\n\n3. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.\n\n4. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\n\n5. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\n\n          John 1:1-5\n\n\nBeloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.\n\nHe that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\n\nIn this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.\n\nHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\n\nBeloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\n\nNo man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.\n\nHereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.\n\nAnd we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.\n\nWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.\n\nAnd we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\n\nHerein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.\n\nThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.\n\nWe love him, because he first loved us.\n\nIf a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\n\nAnd this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.\n\n        1 John 4:7-21\n\n1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:\n\n2. Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\n\n3.

Then when I get home I plug it into my 34 inch 1440p 144hz Ultrawide monitor with a display port to USB C cable and wireless keyboard and mouse. It can play the latest AAA games at high settings or can max out the framerates for the competitive games. \n\nIf you have anything more than a passing interest in gaming, the G15 is the much better choice than an XPS 15. If all you're after is productivity/work oriented use case then I'd save a couple bucks and get an M1 MacBook Air.

I'm driving a car with Auto Cruise Control, and I tried using it in jams during peak hours. The function works perfectly, but I couldn't figure out if my brake lights are illuminating when the car slows down automatically due to traffic in front. Would be nice if someone could test this out as well so I could know if I should use this function in the future or not..."", 'I wonder if you’re aware that these cars also engage the brake lights constantly anytime the car is going even slightly downhill with the cruise control engaged? People are reporting that even after the new brake light software update that just came out this ridiculous issue still exists.  The car is not slowing down whatsoever but the brake lights stay on constantly. I hope you’ll do another video showing this after the updates and maybe it will stir Hyundai to action again. Thanks for all the great videos that you post.', 'As usual, GREAT critique, my friend!  And I know this may be slightly off topic, but if anyone is going to get hot under the collar about this DANGEROUS fail, I know you will.  It\'s the function you mention in this review -- the Auto Assist Cruse Control.  I have this on my 2018 Honda Civic and I understand that it is a now a common function on most all cars since the last 10 years.  When engaged, it will allow the car to cruse at a speed that you set, but it will also sense the speed of the car in front of you and it will adjust your car\'s speed to that car all the way down to a full stop should that car stop.  It will also  sense if an object of any kind moves into your car\'s path.  That all works just fine...until it doesn\'t.  No question It is quite an advantage, especially when you are driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic for long periods of time.  It takes the stress out of having to focus intently on what the car in front of you is doing - BUT here\'s a VERY SERIOUS FLAW, much more of a potential hazard that your break light issue.  \n\nIn my Civic, I can be driving along for a long time, just for laughs, let\'s say an hour with the AACC engaged.  The car has been faithfully watching the car in front of me and slowing down when it slows down, stopping when it stops and going again when it starts to move again.  I am lured into total confidence that my car will stop when necessary and it will...IF, that is, I didn\'t inadvertently step on the brake, even for an instant, during that hour because if you even just tap that brake peddle for a second, the AACC will disengage completely and your car will NO LONGER follow the car in front to a full stop, au contraire mon fraire, it WONT STOP; it will just keep on cruising...RIGHT INTO the car in front of you!  So how come I don\'t realize the Auto Assist Cruise Control is OFF?  Well be cause the Honda engineers did not give me any substantial indication that the AACC has turned off. I am still driving oblivious to that changed condition, thinking it is still on and protecting me from a collision.   \n\nTERRIBLE HUMAN INTERFACE -- The indicator for the AACC function is a small little icon in the upper right hand corner of the dash.  When it is ON, that minuscule icon shows a small number, like say 55, meaning the cruse control speed is set at 55mph and it will keep the car moving at 55 miles per hour unless a car in front of it slows down.  When you stip on the brake and the AACC turns off, the only indicaton that that has happened, is the 55 changes to OFF.  And get this -- the position of the AACC icon not only is very small, it is placed where t can easily be totally obscured by the steering wheel, depending on your height.  And even if you do see it, it is so easy not be aware that it has changed and is indicating that your car now wants to keep driving at whatever speed it\'s going at and it WON\'T STOP no matter if that car in front of you has come to a total stop, YOUR car will plow right into its rear.  \n\nI contend that if a mechanism that will prevent my car from crashing into anything in front of it be switched from ON to OFF,  there should be some indication should be happening that is obvious and insistent and demanding and a lot more dramatic than a little 10 point text in the corner of the dash changing from 55 to OFF.  I say , the whole damn dash should flash red and a loud audible alert should sound to let me know that I now have control of the car and I better pay attention and  brake when necessary, because my car isn\'t going to do it for me!  \n\nI have spoken to friends who own both American cars and imports and they all have this same flaw -- the feedback to the driver that the AACC has switched off is almost non-existent, and THAT, I must say, is potentially even more dangerous than brake lights not functioning as expected.  And putting potential injury aside, even from a fault issue, a brake light fail on a Ecar will cause the car behind you to possibly crash into you -- THEIR fault; the AACC fail on any car and YOU will crash into the car in front of you -- YOUR fault. \n\nAnd here\'s the thing, the Honda designers already are aware of what to do to get the driver\'s attention on this kind of auto functionally; for example, the Lane Assist function -- when that function is turned ON, allowing the car\'s sensors to keep the car centered in the lane, if you take your hands off the wheel for more than 10 seconds, a big yellow bar flashes across the FULL dash with the words in bold 34 point text: DRIVING REQUIRED, plus a loud rapid beeping sound.  The SAME thing should happen if you just tap the brake while driving with AACC engaged -- that same level of warning feedback should happen to let you know, you\'ve just set your car to hurl itself into anything that\'s in front at whatever speed you\'ve set it to ""cruise"" at.  I\'m just sayin...', ""go on an older car with those 3 separated taillights and lift your foot off the accelerator. it's the same shit and you can't solve it mechanically, only by a software, because both have engine braking"", 'Careful with your recall request.  Manufacturer might take cheapest solution and simply wire brake lights *ON* all the time if there is no minimum deceleration requirement.  ;)', 'The solution is very simple.\nWhen you lift partially off the accelerator and regen braking kicks in there should be a sensor to detect even light regen braking to illuminate the brake light.

The early EV conversions didn't mix pedals with fancy brake blending so they put a bunch of regen into the accelerator pedal which allows the one pedal driving you refer to.  So, I was always happy with the brake light trigger point when driving this car... until, I finally updated it from lead acid batteries to lithium ion, with the drastically reduced weight, the car would decelerate quickly without illuminating the brake light.  I found an old PC laptop, loaded up the windows 98 app for RS485 telnet and calibration, adjusted the setting, and was good again.

You\'re doing 65 in a truck, possibly towing something.  Do you mash the brakes?

I always drive with both feet (one on the gas, the other on the brake in an automatic car) because it gives the best reaction times in the event of braking or accelerating.

I often hear that you shouldn't drive with two feet because you might confuse the petals, I mean this can happen with one foot too (if you can confuse 1 foot to 1 petal, it seems more likely that people would confuse 1 foot with 2 pedals which is why I often see people hit the accelerator instead of the brake when driving with 1 foot).

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n\n38. This is the first and great commandment.\n\n39. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n\n40. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\n\n      Matthew 22:37-40\n\n8. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.\n\n           Psalm 34:8\n\n5. Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\n\n6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\n\n7. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.\n\n          Proverbs 3:5-7\n\n21. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\n\n         Matthew 1:21\n\nWhen Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\n\nAnd they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\n\nHe saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?\n\nAnd Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\n\nAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n\nAnd I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n\n          Matthew 16:13-19\n\n16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\n17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\n\n18. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n\n19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\n\n          John 3:16-19\n\nFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n               Romans 6:23\n\n16. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\n\n             Mark 16:16\n\n1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n\n2. The same was in the beginning with God.\n\n3. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.\n\n4. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\n\n5. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\n\n          John 1:1-5\n\n\nBeloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.\n\nHe that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\n\nIn this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.\n\nHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.\n\nBeloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\n\nNo man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.\n\nHereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.\n\nAnd we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.\n\nWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.\n\nAnd we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\n\nHerein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.\n\nThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.\n\nWe love him, because he first loved us.\n\nIf a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\n\nAnd this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.\n\n        1 John 4:7-21\n\n1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:\n\n2. Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.\n\n3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\n\n       Revelation 1:1-3\n\n16. I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.\n\n17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\n\n18. For i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:\n\n19. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\n\n20.

These early musings were basic, and focused on imitating human-to-human digital interactions. Many years later, I was a partner with IBM, helping to showcase its flagship predictive analytics software, essentially a powerful ""AI"" tool focusing on making reliably accurate predictions using large datasets. For example, IBM\'s ""SPSS Modeler"" works by using training models of known variable values, and uses the power of modern computer processors to compute very large sets of training data in order to predict possible outcomes of similar, new data inputs. As powerful a tool as this tech is, it is ""dumb AI"": that is, it is not capable of genuine reasoning, and can only execute programmed instructions, which makes it only a tool, albeit, a sophisticated and impressive tool. What most uninitiated people do not understand is that basic ""AI"" is not actually ""intelligent"", and is not hard to build. This is what currently exists, impacting virtually every aspect of our modern lives. However, artificial general (and independent) intelligence is the so-called ""holy grail"" of the field of AI, especially data science. We are nowhere near achieving this technology.

When discussing stereo-difference signals, I declared that that\'s what\'s on the record - which is arguably true but only when you consider lateral and vertical stylus movements in isolation. The raw L&R channels are still encoded as purely diagonal groove movement, but the phase difference in the the cutting head\'s actuators ensures that those movements, when combined and equal to one another, only result in lateral motion. The cartridge also has its pickups wired with the same phase arrangement to ensure the L&R channels are in phase with one another when playing a mono record (or the virtual center of a stereo record).\r\nIs that a mono signal in the lateral motion with stereo-difference information in vertical motion? Well... you decide!', ""Allow me to introduce a new unit of measurement for sound volume,\nwhich I call vovol* (abbreviated: volume voltage).\n\nTHIS IS HOW IT WORKS: You use two pre-stages, one with positive volume values, and the other negative.\nFor example, so has the pre-step with positive values\na measurement from +0 decibels up to +20, while the one with negative values, has from -0 decibels down to -20 decibels.\n\nThe highest voltage occurs when the value is\n+20 and -20 decibels (or: 20 vovol),\nwhile there is low voltage, when the value is on\n+0 and -0 decibels (or: 0 vovol).\n\nYou can possibly also combine two different values with each other, by adjusting the value to +10 -20 vovol, which gives a crisper effect. Have experimented with this myself at work and at home.\n\nThe adjustment can of course be set to taste, but the purpose of vovol for me is to equalize the sound volume, so that you better hear weak sounds and at the same time avoid high deafening sound levels (loudness war's).\n\nThank you for reading this!\nTake care of your hearing...\n\n:-)"", 'So how did the laser reading record player work? 🤔\nI really need to find out what it was called. 🙄', 'I like your Wotorola t-shirt', 'Vinyl has no perfect stereo seperation, but do we need this?

What most people don\'t understand is that most of what digital is capable of acheiving in terms of accuracy is redundant. The stereo separation argument is a case in point. LP looks very poor until you discover that a) human perception of stereo separation is also very poor and b) analogue amplifiers (and ultimately they all have to end up as analogue at some point in the chain) also have far worse stereo separation than digital formats are capable of. So in that frame of reference LP doesn\'t actually fall that far of the mark of being able to reproduce ""adequate"" stereo separation audio playback. It\'s a very similar argument to the CD vs ""hi-res"" digital formats. hi-res is redundant, as it\'s performance envelope is so far beyond what humans are capable of perceiving (in every metric not just frequency response) that it\'s pointless. CD\'s basic 44.1khz/16 bit is more than capable of capturing far more than humans can perceive (in every way). LP may be bad in comparison but it\'s actually not that far off what humans are capable of perceiving, so the reality is that CD just doesn\'t (in absolute terms not subjective preference terms) actually give huge improvement in fidelity. Yes LP will distort to the order of 1-2% at high frequencies, but humans are pretty much incapbable of hearing that level of distortion at those frequencies anyway, so it\'s moot that CD can achieve way below those figures. People don\'t want to accept it, but objectively human hearing is actually pretty bad. High end LP replay systems were capable of reproducing a very high fidelity sound, CD improved it, but not by as large a margin as many people want to believe.

The Egyptian pyramids were built using primative mechanical advantage systems tools and man, horse power. They did no what the wheel was, it was a tree trunk cut up, they made many for their systems. They made it how we would make it. The tool that the Egyptians used a lot for leverage and measuring I worked out a long time ago. On the large pyramids they used a spoked type wheel with no rim it was not round is was just like connected spokes it didn't roll, there were 7 spokes. Perfectly spaced. 6 and 8 wouldn't have worked. This would have been rotated to pace the base out in equal steps. It would always have a perpendicular perfect perpendicular spoke. The perfect angle of the pyramid was a straight line from one of the bottom spokes to the adjacent spoke. It is 51.42875 not 51.5 degrees they need to go back and re measure it  and consider the age and erosion. It was also used for getting it level by eye no spirit level. If you draw all of this  out and start measuring other things you will find that pi 3.142 can be found to equate it all together with it's height. It also suggests that the spokes had a rim and was rolled to measure the base. They knew how to construct, they did not know about pi. That came later with the Greeks.

Honestly i think Linus and employees are burnt out... they need to go back to basic's again... otherwise the community will just not take anything seriously what LMG puts out and soon LMG will fail... sometimes its better to admit you made mistakes at least the community will know that they are humans and things like this happen. in a nutshell the cocky Linus got too cocky and now its biting him in the ass..

With the monoblock situation it feels like he doubled and tripled down and only when Linus had to be convinced otherwise did he even feign an apology. Cracking dumb ass jokes on an apology video. I feel bad this could be the end of one of my favorite channels, also have my doubts this just doesn't get brushed aside and they continue like nothing happened.\n\nThe homie Madison, I feel for her she seems genuine. It's the 2020s but things really haven't changed much for women from the 80s in certain aspects, I've witnessed it maybe when I was younger I even inadvertently took part in it.

The reason for this is that I would notice inconsistencies with the stuff he reviewed in his video. It would be like him getting different specs than what I was.

All electric switchboards in a local community should be able to share the local renewable electricity with the homes that don't have any in case of a power outage. The grid should be able to tell the meter that it's only delivering a limited intensity during a power outage, so that all non-essential circuits are automatically cut or alternatively switched on and off, etc.\n\nA lot of work needs to be done on the building code and common sense too. If you count the number of roof panes on an average American home, it's usually well over 10, when we really should limit it to 1 or 2 to maximize solar, with all openings moved to the highest roofline so it does not mess with the solar array. Rooftop windows and solar thermal panels could have the same dimensions as solar photovoltaic panels (which would also benefit from some size standardization). Solar could be an integral part of a weatherproof rooftop instead of some wart sitting on top," making it like a smaller roof superposed to the regular roof. And so on.\nWe could also make it easier and cheaper to renew old roofs that reach their end of life with well-insulated solar ones."""""," """"Part of the issue in California is that PGE (one of the three or so companies", but I believe the biggest) isn't a totally public (government) company, and so because of that, any lessening of solar benefits is seen as a profit motive.

To a certain extent, the more people with solar and batteries, the less strain on the grid, and the less power needed to be generated from natural gas (our biggest tracked pollutor, since it's difficult to track generation from out of state). This would also help to a degree with the duck curve as well.

Here's a comment with some extra info on efficiency and the metering devices used in heat pumps.\nFirst: my wording on the efficiency drop in the cold was sloppy, and it sounds like I'm suggesting the need for defrosting is the only reason it loses efficiency. It is _a_ reason, but not the biggest one - that's simply that as the outdoor temperature gets colder, it's harder for the refrigerant to absorb heat because the temperature difference between it and the air gets smaller. In fact, in the clip when it was -10°, it wasn't building much frost at all because it was very dry. But that was so cold that the refrigerant could barely capture any energy, which is why its output was tepid. And to be clear, its rating down to 5° doesn't mean it operates at full efficiency at that temperature. That's just the lowest temperature that it can sustain its rated heating output.\nRe: metering devices. I still somewhat suspect that the mini-split has a capillary tube and largely because of its cost. It was surprisingly inexpensive (this unit was about $1000, but the smallest units from this same manufacture only cost $750 and are fully capable heat pumps). If you use a thermal expansion valve or similar, you need one for each direction which adds to the system's complexity somewhat. I'd still argue that it hardly does - it is, after all, one or two small components of a large system. But simply reversing the refrigerant flow doesn't work on its own in systems that use these more complex metering devices. They'd need some additional piping and valve work (some such valves were visible in the demo rig) to accommodate two metering devices for each direction of flow."", 'I have never even heard of heat pumps before but this is very educational. Thank you 🙏', 'Beans 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🍆', ""For those of us who live in hot climates, like me in Phoenix, the heat pump is all that's needed in winter. But, in summer having an swamp cooler (evaporative cooler) really helps. Just as the heat pump can run into a wall when the cold winter gets too cold, it can also run into a wall when the hot summer gets too hot. Heat pumps are amazing and wonderful, and really the furnace or swamp cooler should only be occasional additional help. Interestingly, though, the swamp cooler can actually help improve the efficiency of the heat pump in summer. Air conditioning (including heat pump) will dry air, as you pointed out. Swamp coolers saturate air with moisture to cool it. So cooling by putting moisture in the air and then having another system remove moisture, and thermal energy contained in the moisture, from the air makes that system even more efficient. \n\nWhen it's 120+ F out, we also need all the help we can get to cool down. It's fascinating that we can both use heat pumps, but the secondary system needs to add heat in cold weather in your area but not mine while I need to cooling capability in hot weather but you don't. But, we have the heat pump as the whole-house primary system instead of the room system. \n\nWhat's amazing is how heat pumps seem to be some kind of alien future tech there. I visited France and Bulgaria, as well as Spain, in August last year and it was hot. I mean, not as bad as I'm accustomed to here in Phoenix, but there was a heat wave there. For some strange reason some hotels have no air conditioning in the rooms, let alone heat pumps. I spoke with people about heat pumps and they were surprised to learn such a thing exists.

It's warm much of the year there of course so it can be fairly mediocre, but there is a need for heating when it gets cool there and because it often doesn't (and so buildings are often quite draughty and clothing is mainly for warmer times of the year) even fairly mild temperatures can cause a lot of problems.

Fair Trade is the only way to solve that', 'Most of food safety problems and the overall poor quality of many products are due to high labor costs that AI could solve. Also, much more recycling could be done. So many car parts that used to be rebuilt, are now thrown away. AI could reverse this trend.', '""I notice there are still people confused about why an AGI would kill us, exactly. Its actually pretty simple, I’ll try to keep my explanation here as concise as humanly possible:\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is this: As we improve AI, it will get better and better at achieving the goals we give it. Eventually, AI will be powerful enough to tackle most tasks you throw at it. \r\n\r\nBut there’s an inherent problem with this. The AI we have now only cares about achieving its goal in the most efficient way possible. That’s no biggie now, but the moment our AI systems start approaching human level intelligence, it suddenly becomes very dangerous. It’s goals don’t even have to change for this to be the case. I’ll give you a few examples.\r\n\r\nEx 1: Lets say its the year 2030, you have a basic AGI agent program on your computer, and you give it the goal: “Make me money”. You might return the next day & find your savings account has grown by several million dollars. But only after checking it’s activity logs do you realize that the AI acquired all of the money through phishing, stealing, & credit card fraud. It achieved your goal, but not in a way you would have wanted or expected.\r\n\r\nEx 2: Lets say you’re a scientist, and you develop the first powerful AGI Agent. You want to use it for good, so the first goal you give it is “cure cancer”. However, lets say that it turns out that curing cancer is actually impossible. The AI would figure this out, but it still wants to achieve it’s goal. So it might decide that the only way to do this is by killing all humans, because it technically satisfies its goal; no more humans, no more cancer. It will do what you said, and not what you meant.\r\n\r\nThese may seem like silly examples, but both actually illustrate real phenomenon that we are already observing in today’s AI systems. The first scenario is an example of what AI researchers call the “negative side effects problem”. And the second scenario is an example of something called “reward hacking”.\r\n\r\nNow, you’d think that as AI got smarter, it’d become less likely to make these kinds of “mistakes”. However, the opposite is actually true. Smarter AI is actually more likely to exhibit these kinds of behaviors. Because the problem isn’t that it doesn’t understand what you want. It just doesn’t actually care. It only wants to achieve its goal, by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nSo, the question is then: how do we prevent this potentially dangerous behavior? Well, there’s 2 possible methods.\r\n\r\nOption 1: You could try to explicitly tell it everything it can’t do (don’t hurt humans, don’t steal, don’t lie, etc). But remember, it’s a great problem solver. So if you can’t think of literally EVERY SINGLE possibility, it will find loopholes. Could you list every single way an AI could possible disobey or harm you? No, it’s almost impossible to plan for literally everything.\r\n\r\nOption 2: You could try to program it to actually care about what people want, not just reaching it’s goal. In other words, you’d train it to share our values. To align it’s goals and ours. If it actually cared about preserving human lives, obeying the law, etc. then it wouldn’t do things that conflict with those goals.\r\n\r\nThe second solution seems like the obvious one, but the problem is this; we haven’t learned how to do this yet. To achieve this, you would not only have to come up with a basic, universal set of morals that everyone would agree with, but you’d also need to represent those morals in its programming using math (AKA, a utility function). And that’s actually very hard to do.\r\n\r\nThis difficult task of building AI that shares our values is known as the alignment problem. There are people working very hard on solving it, but currently, we’re learning how to make AI powerful much faster than we’re learning how to make it safe.\r\n\r\nSo without solving alignment, everytime we make AI more powerful, we also make it more dangerous. And an unaligned AGI would be very dangerous; give it the wrong goal, and everyone dies. This is the problem we’re facing, in a nutshell.""\r\n\nComment by @HauntedHarmonics from ""How We Prevent the AI’s from Killing us with Paul Christiano""', 'We should use it to learn ❤', 'Why do we NEED it.

The most recent prediction about the advancement of AI was that it would reach some crazy level of filling prompts within 6 months to a year, but it happened within 45 days, and the person who made that prediction said he couldn't believe what just happened, and that it made him nervous for the future, being AI moving faster than we humans can even digest.

The timeline for achieving general-purpose AI, as mentioned by the speaker, is highly speculative and subject to a wide range of uncertainties.\n\nPredicting the exact timeline for the development of general AI is an extremely challenging task, as it requires not only significant advancements in technology but also a deep understanding of human cognition and consciousness. While some experts may speculate about a possible timeline, it is crucial to recognize that these are educated guesses at best.\n\nMoreover, even if general-purpose AI becomes a reality in the future, it is essential to consider the ethical, social, and economic implications associated with such advancements. AI has the potential to disrupt various industries, reshape the job market, and raise profound ethical questions. It is crucial to approach AI development with careful consideration and ensure that it aligns with our values and societal well-being.\n\nRather than focusing solely on predicting a specific timeline for general AI, it is more constructive to have ongoing discussions about the responsible and ethical implementation of AI technologies, addressing concerns such as bias, transparency, and accountability. By adopting a critical and cautious approach, we can better navigate the complexities of AI and harness its potential for the benefit of humanity.', 'We will always be running out of resources even when we deplete the solar system.

The free market is working as intended.', ""WHAT IF MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WITHDRAW ALL THEIR BANK SAVINGS TOMORROW, 3/13/2023? \r\n\r\nIf a large number of Americans were to withdraw all of their savings from banks at once, it could potentially have significant implications for the banking system and the broader economy.\r\n\r\nBanks use customer deposits to fund loans and investments, so a sudden and significant decrease in deposits could limit their ability to lend money and finance economic activity. This could lead to a contraction in credit markets, reduced investment, and slower economic growth.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if everyone were to withdraw all their savings at the same time, there may not be enough physical cash to meet the demand, which could lead to long lines at banks and ATMs, and potentially even a cash shortage.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note, however, that it's unlikely that a large number of Americans would suddenly withdraw all of their savings at once. Even during times of economic uncertainty, many people rely on their savings for emergencies and daily expenses and may not have the means to withdraw all of their funds at once.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's important to be cautious and informed when making decisions about your finances, and to consider the potential risks and consequences of any actions you take.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF AMERICANS LOSE THEIR TRUST ON BANKS?\r\n\r\nIn general, people's confidence in banks can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as economic conditions, bank policies, and regulatory oversight. If there is a perception that a bank is in financial trouble or is engaging in risky behavior, it could undermine people's trust in that bank and potentially the banking system as a whole.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's worth noting that banks in the United States are subject to regulatory oversight and are required to hold a certain amount of capital to protect against losses. Additionally, the FDIC insures deposits up to a certain amount, which can help to mitigate the risk of bank failures.\r\n\r\nOverall, the level of confidence that Americans have in banks may vary depending on a range of factors and individual experiences.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FDIC PAY FOR EACH ACCOUNT?\r\n\r\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. This means that if an insured bank were to fail, each depositor's account would be covered up to $250,000, including principal and accrued interest.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the $250,000 limit applies to each depositor's accounts at a given bank, so if you have multiple accounts at the same bank, they are added together, and the total amount insured is up to $250,000. Additionally, if you have accounts at different banks, each bank is separately insured up to $250,000 per depositor.\r\n\r\nThe FDIC provides a comprehensive guide to deposit insurance on their website, which includes information about what types of accounts are covered and how to maximize your insurance coverage. If you have specific questions about your FDIC insurance coverage, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or contact the FDIC directly.\r\n\r\nHYPOTHETICALLY, WHAT IF THE SAVINGS WORTH $45M, HOW MUCH WILL THE FDIC REIMBURSE THE LOSES?\r\n\r\nIf an individual had a savings account worth $45 million at an FDIC-insured bank that failed, the FDIC would only insure up to $250,000 of the total amount. This means that the depositor would be reimbursed up to $250,000 and would lose the remaining amount that exceeded the insurance limit.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that there are ways to potentially increase the amount of FDIC insurance coverage for large deposits, such as by spreading the funds across multiple accounts or by using different ownership categories. However, it's important to consult with a financial advisor or contact the FDIC directly to understand the rules and limitations of deposit insurance.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's generally recommended to spread large deposits across multiple FDIC-insured banks to maximize FDIC insurance coverage and reduce the risk of losses due to bank failures."", 'Can I ask a very basic, but surprisingly nobody mentioned question, why so many VCs choose SVB and FRB, not choose bigger national banks (such as Chase, BOA, Citi, etc), or smaller banks (such as credit unions), what kind of service are so unique and attractive, can not understand at this moment.', 'NO BAILOUT FOR SVB.

Jesus is Jehovah God\'s (The Creator\'s) Word made into flesh.\n1 John chapter 5 verse 7: "" For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are One.""\nJohn chapter 1 verse 1: ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\nJohn chapter 1 verse 14: "" And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.""\nJohn chapter 1 verse 10: "" He was in the world, and the world\xa0 knew Him not.""\nHebrews chapter 4 verse 12: "" For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.""\nHow beautiful and awesome is God\'s Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, magnificent in all His glory, is He. Amen!\nJohn\'s Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven:\nRevelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3:\n "" Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.""\nWhy did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us?\nChrist (God\'s Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam\'s flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh(Jesus Christ\'s flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death\xa0 shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell.\nChrist, who is God\'s Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions.\nChrist died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,\xa0 Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power(God the Father). Through Christ\'s sacrifice we gain Salvation through God\'s abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus.\nJohn chapter 3 verse 16: "" For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.""\nRomans chapter 5 verse 8: "" But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.""\nChrist came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam.\nDeath in Adam, Life In Christ:\nRomans chapter 5 verse 19: "" For as by one man\'s disobedience(Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man\'s obedience(Jesus) , many will be made righteous.""\nRomans chapter 5 verse 18: "" Therefore, as through one man\'s (Adam\'s) offense, judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man\'s (Christ\'s) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.""\nRomans chapter 5 verse 17: "" For if by the one man\'s offense(Adam\'s offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One(Jesus Christ).\nRomans chapter 5 verse 12: "" Therefore, just as through one man (Adam), sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.""\nRomans chapter 5 verse 21: "" ""So that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.""\n\xa0Do you now see that through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly? Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation.\nAdam\'s flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation.\n1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, ""For since by man (Adam) came death, by Man (Jesus) also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive.""\nChrist\'s sacrifice, the crucifixtion\xa0 of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, life, resurrection, eternal life, salvation\nChrist is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, waring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all. Amen! Amen! Hallelujah!\nRevelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: "" And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. ""\nNow do you see friends, Why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes.\nNow, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes.\nChrist is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men(us humans).\nGod loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God\'s Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us.\nWill you accept Christ and be saved?\nRomans chapter 6 verse 23: ""\xa0 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.""\nJohn Chapter 3 verse 16: "" For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that who ever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.""\nSalvation is free!\nChrist already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach, repent of your sins, and keep His commands.\nSo who is Christ?\nHe is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is Salvation. He is the Way, the Truth, and Life. He is The Rock. Amen! I love you Lord!\nGod created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know, that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes.\nJohn chapter 14 verse 6: "" Jesus said to him,"" I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.""\nColassians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16:\nHe is the Image of the Invisible God, the Firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven, and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.""\nJohn chapter 1 verse 1 to 4:\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\xa0God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.""\nI hope that you know Christ, and understand Christ better now, to the glory of God.\xa0Amen!\nChrist is for all who will receive Him.\nThis is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13:\n""Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.""\nNow that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Amen!\nRepent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name.\nSubmit to Jehovah-God.\nLove God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God\'s Commandments. Love one another.\nForgive one another. It is written, ""resist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you.""\nHate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.\nHebrews 9:2, ""For if we sin willfully, after we received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.""\n\nOnly Jesus The Christ, can baptize you with God\'s Holy Spirit. Only Christ can give you The Holy Spirit, and the Gifts of The Spirit.\nActs 11 vs. 15 to 16, "" And as I began to speak, The Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ""John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.""\nRead Exodus Chapter 20, The 10 Commandments of God.\nShare the Gospel of Christ with others.', 'cây đa cây đề có khác', '3:33 Germany should have spent the VDE 8 money on Nuclear Power infrastructure.

El Pollo 🐥 saliendo en Polémica 😂 😂😂', 'Yo trabajé en una mesa de servicio 24/7 durante dis años, era normal que nuestros turnos de trabajo se extendieran hasta 10, 12, 14 incluso 16 horas por emergencias, a veces iba terminando mi turno, lkegando a casa, y me tenía que conectar remotamente por una intermitencia climática satelital, una ruptura en un enlace de fibra, un siniestro, etc; además, nuestro roll de turnos, era, dos dias de la semana, entrar a las 6:00 am, dis días entrar a las 14:00Hrs, y dos días de 22:00Hrs a 6:00Hrs del día siguiente, era extenuante nuestro trabajo y muy estresante, pero por lo mismo, estabamos excentos de esos llamados en los que ""todos los trabajadores sin excepción se tienen que presentar para aplaudirke a un directivo megalómano en una ceremonia de la empresa"", y en nuestro día y medio de descanso, nadie del trabajo, ni siqiun directivo, podía molestarnos ni pedirnos nada de emergencia, y eramos los únicos de la empresa a quienes nos pagaban horas extra dobles y hasta triples cuando rebasábamos las 36, al resto, les pagaban con un tabulador que iba desde el 25% al 75% más por cada hora extra.', 'Gran opinión!; me parece que Gamers Nexus lo hizo de manera mal intencionada tirando a agresivo como si de problemas mas personales se tratase, uso un lenguaje pasivo agresivo y vulgar para luego decir que estaba siendo objetivo y se lavo las manos escudandose diciendo que no iba a sacar ningun beneficio de ello cuando la verdad trajo muchisima tracción al canal y parece más un movimiento de marketing que un video por amor al arte. Espero LTT pueda seguir adelante y es necesario y solucionen los problemas internos incluyendo las gravisimas acusaciones a la empresa. Es imposible hacer una opinión en una comunidad tan tóxica como el PC gaming inglés donde los canales que han intentado abordar todo han sido llenados de hate; además de ser algo sucio atacar unicamente a la persona en lugar de la empresa, Linus es un miembro más de una corporación de considerable tamaño (ni si quiera es el CEO actualmente) y algunos comentarios hacia el y su esposa son repulsivos.', 'La verdad se nota que en este canal quieren mucho a ltt xD. Seria bueno que sean un poco mas objetivos. Pero estuvo bueno el mitote.', 'Primero ni siquiera estan diciendo porque Gamer Nexus saco el video en contra de LTT. al menos al minuto 18 que deje de ver sus comentarios erroneos, un empleado de LTT dijo que ellos eran mejores que GN y hardware unbox, porque ellos siempre testeaban todo y los otros reusaban info pero como diciendo LTT somos mejores, GN solo se defendio, es como si a ustedes otro canal les dice que son mejores que ustedes porque no son chayoteros de las marcas, hahahaha. Aparte se ve que no ven seguido Gamer Nexus, ellos son reporteros de tecnología serios, ustedes no entenderian porque son chayoteros de las marcas, encima ustedes tambien critican el producto que Linus subasto y que no era de el y ni han de saber que era.  Adios solo los vi porque salio en el algoritmo pero sabia que dirian puras tonterias e informarian desde su punto de vista, no de una manera neutral.', 'A mí con LTT me pasó lo mismo que con Nate Gentile. En algún punto eran referencia las reviews que hacían, pero cuando crecieron simplemente se volvieron puro marketing, publicidad para marcas y clickbaits. Es legítimo, pero para quienes buscamos una review objetiva de un producto, con análisis serios, obviamente dejaron de ser opción. De hecho con LTT me pasa hace mucho tiempo que yo, un simple mortal, notaba que varios de sus analisis eran completamente equivocados, faltos de datos o descontextualizados. Con situaciones en que literal el video decía ""esto es mejor"", ¿pero por qué es mejor?\n\nCreo que mis canales favoritos de hardware en inglés son Gamers Nexus y Hardware Unboxed. En general Gamers Nexus suelen tener el ""folclore"" de echarle tierra algo, como por ejemplo a las marcas, me imagino que para decirle a la gente ""somos independientes"" y no nos interesa quedar bien con las marcas. Obviamente hay algo de show en todo eso, pero tampoco es para dramatizar. Es verdad también que de vez en cuando les gusta entrar en la polémica, no necesariamente por cosas demasiado importantes, pero su contenido general no se basa en polémicas, y suelen hacer analisis muy completos. Aquí no hay forma de estar del lado de LTT.', '""reunion de emergencia"" jajaja', 'Jejejejeje tranki chicos todos sabemos que Draks nunca sera gamers nexus, osea por el cabello, el Draks no tiene 😂😂😂', 'Pero dejen hablar a Yulia xd', 'Huy que lavada de cara que le hacen a Linus, se echaron un fajardo con todas!

LTT aunque es entretenido, a veces es un ambicioso vulgar, además irrespetuoso con los productos  que le dan para reseñar. Era cuestion de tiempo xd', 'Linus media es el canal más grande de youtube en su género, la ambición los ha llevado a sacar más trabajo del que pueden realizar, por lo que para aumentar ingresos han disminuido calidad y esa es la critica de gamernexus, no existe quién los revise como canales y esos errores distorsionan la realidad de su público, hizo lo correcto, porque no existe ni un sólo canal de techtubers mostrando los mismos datos, inclusive utilizando hardware similar lo que lleva a confusión y peleas de credibilidad, ejemplo el tortillero o el enmascarado a amd siempre lo pondrán en el peor escenario con desventajas donde un i3 le gane al 78003D al mero estilo userbenchmark y un michael o ancientgameplays que pondrán a amd en sus mejores condiciones pero sin demeritar a la otra compañía facciosamente, eso es lo que la calidad de personas hace al canal de contenido, como sea ni linus o gamernexus han callado ante las tácticas de monopolio de nvidia o intel y esa ha sido la razón de su éxito, ojala mucha banda latina aprendiera eso, en lugar de generar fanatismo o favoritismo hacia una marca.', 'Me agrada que hayan dicho lo de no poner a ningún Techtuber o reviewer en un PEDESTAL como si sea dios. Todos la c4g4m0s, y pues realmente si me enferma que haya gente y amigos de USA que se toman como dios las palabras de GN. Si Steve dice X producto es basura x y z, uno de ellos literal se mete esa mentalidad en la cabeza. X producto es basura por x y z.

Y se ve que les cae muy mal el Steve, pero ya ven, el no se invento nada, LMG hizo todo lo que el dice en el video, y el no habia dicho nada hasta que le picaron la cresta, y eso le paso a LMG por fantoches, de que les vale sus equipos de miles de dolares que tienen si sus resultados se los inventan.\n\nSaludos', 'El Ed Corsa solo se la pasaba defendiendo a Linus.', 'yo eh visto que tanto gamer nexus como linus sus pruebas que a veces hacen se ven mas de entretenimiento que pruebas que en dia a dia vayan a ocurrir, asi que cada expectador debe tomar con pinzas los datos de cada fabricante y multiples fuentes.', ""Ya imagino\n\nLinus- i'm sorry for our mistakes.

Se tenia que decir y se dijo', 'La situacion actual de Linus denota el cansancio a nivel administrativo que tiene LMG en general. El cambio de CEO deberia poder apoyar a esto y hacer que las cosas mejoren (Ademas de que la situacion se torcio de errores de grabacion, guion y el enrutamiento parcializado de la opinion hacia un caso de acoso que SI puede resultar en algo realmente grave). La actitud de Linus si se hizo grande a medida que su canal se convirtio en una empresa, asi que ya de plano ni al caso en pensar que esto mejore o cambie porque practicamente es ya parte del sello de su marca. Cuando conoci DrogaDigital me di cuenta de la importancia de poder conocer la opinion de muchos canales antes de agarrar algo como ""la verdad absoluta"" ya que muchas de vuestras revisiones siempre terminaban en eso mismo, en que debemos buscar una segunda opinion o de informarse bien ya que en otros canales endiosaban ciertos productos y empresas, o de plano las mandaban al tacho (Pollo -> AMD).

O sea ya vieron lo que hacen unos milímetros en un disipador (ejemplo Noctua con su adaptador para Ryzen 7000)... Sin embargo un producto BETA termina siendo defenestrado por un medio MASIVO por no usarse en el producto objetivo... Imagina usar el turbo de un modelo de auto en otro, seguro se pueda adaptar pero el que vaya bien o mal ya depende de quien haga la adaptación y no del producto sin embargo acá la adaptación fue pésima, el objetivo del vídeo también (poner a alguien que no sabe del tema) y para colmo dar una mala conclusión sobre un producto BETA mal usado... Que sos el canal más grande Tech no sos un canal de 1000 subs.\n\nAdemás VENDER el prototipo en una feria... Un prototipo que aún no salió al mercado... Un prototipo que debían devolver... Y aparte ignorar en gran parte a los creadores tratando de esconder todo bajo la alfombra?...\n\nYo considero a LMG un buen grupo de canales con videos interesantes pero ya son For Fun y no lo veo como un exponente que hable correctamente de ""números""... Ojo que tiene sus buenas exposiciones y tutoriales o traen a la mesa cosas no tan conocidas pero luego For Fun... O For Buy como la cortadora de cesped de Miles de dólares que encima no funcionaba bien 😅.\n\nNo santificó al Jesus de la informática con su cabellera pero creo que a nivel de números, mediciones son un canal excelente... Y eso de hacer un mundo de cosas pequeñas yo lo veo bien para que las empresas mejoren sus productos... Imagínate un usuario promedio con un NZXT (N1?) Prendido fuego quien te reconoce la GPU perdida si eso pasa?.\n\nHubo muchos casos alguno más importantes que otros, yo considero al de Gigabyte importante sin embargo creo que se pasaron (en reprimenda del tipo de contestación de Giga) pero no lo ví mal ya que si ALGUNAS fuentes no tenían protecciones que supuestamente si tenían (o las tenían mal aplicadas/seteadas). Se que Giga no hace sus fuentes y por ende es más complicado pero lo ví necesario no importa si fue una tirada de 1000 fuentes o de 50000 ya que si no se reconoce el problema muy factible mente las RMA se lavan las manos.\n\nHubo muchos casos respecto al conector nuevo de Nvidia, respecto a Asus con las x570 Hero creo.

It refers to the striking and killing of living beings. Taking life is the will to kill anything that one perceives as having life, to act so as to terminate the life-force in it, in so far as the will finds expression in bodily action or in speech. With regard to animals it is worse to kill large ones than small. Because a more extensive effort is involved. Even where the effort is the same, the difference in substance must be considered.\nIn the case of humans the killing is the more blameworthy the more virtuous they are. Apart from that, the extent of the offense is proportionate to the intensity of the wish to kill. Five factors are involved: a living being, the perception of a living being, a thought of murder, the action of carrying it out, and death as a result of it. And six are the ways in which the offense may be carried out: with one’s own hand\nPlease Don't Kill Them....They Are So Good And Kind Animals...Everyone Has Right To Live On This Earth...Please It's Request...I Literally Cried After Watching This...Please Don't Kill"", 'Jib.hatiya.eyk.mohapap.hotahey.\nJousko.khatahey.oh.insan.neyhihota.ohbastard.hotahey.oh.ohi.janamfèr.prapat.hotahey.jeyisa.karini.\nAisavharini.', 'Kutta herami', 'Deceived in a good way', 'Human is the most evil creature  I ever seen .', 'Вот как коровам педикюр делают!', 'Disturbing....now realized...why war..earthquake...cyclone..other calamity we face...', 'That thumbnail 💀', 'WHAT THE F&^K IS WITH THE THUMBNAIL FOR THIS VIDEO, .............

A conflict of interest happens even if Steve says he's not influenced by the sponsorship when he reviews products from said sponsor.

That’s why full disclosure is a must, and it’s there for the most part AFAIK.\n2. As for the games list - I think (and that’s a personal opinion) that they use a very good list of games since they are the most popular games and their graphical complexity and requirements are very well known. \n\nOther than that I mostly agree with you, and I am especially disgusted by the responses you got back than.', ""Oh, no.

You left out the test results for the Deepcool cpu cooler. This suggests to me that Gamers Nexus subjectively reviewed the cooler and had a based result which doesn't fit into your narrative. Alternatively, you truly believe that anytime someone is sponsered by a company and review their product, regardless of test results, there is a conflict of interest. To that extent, you could argue anyone with brand loyalty, regardless of sponsership, has a conflict of interest. \n\nAnyway, your argument against Gamers Nexus is pretty weak in my opinion.

(harder to do on a smaller scale) \n\nI found GN´s accusations in that direction very speculative. \n\n\nAlso if you call somebody a fraud the majority will understand it exactly as they do, using a less aggressive language is much better in such situations (saying that LMG is potentially misleading customers is no problem but calling them a fraud is, especially if you want to say something less actionable.) In the end semantics are totally irrelevant - you´ll always be judged by what the majority thinks you said not by what you actually wanted to say - even legally.

I get sponsorships and especially in the tech space outaide of the big three (AMD, INTEL, NVIDIA) there isnt a whole lot to sponsorships from.

It would be great if anyone adopted the ACG mindset which is ""my only sponsorships is me"" but thats easier for smaller channels to do when they arent entangled in the financial politics of AMD, INTEL, and Nvidia all of which want your blood type, a shrine to their CEO\'s in your bedroom, and a urine sample.

From my perspective as an older person who finally has the money for a 3090. I do care about older games but I want different data now. From my point of view I don't care about high frame rates at 1080 anymore. If I'm shelling out for a 3090 I want all the 4K performance data.

Promoting a product with your name behind it can be murky waters, but they bring up reasonable flaws and strengths in almost every video. \n\nThe idea that tech reviewers shouldn’t have any relationship with product manufacturers may lead to more objective impressions, but that’s not black and white. If you make content that unfairly highlights a brand in a positive (or negative) light regularly, you’re not doing your job and you are crossing the line into fraud. \n\nWhat I see from LMG is a general willingness to state good, bad and ugly about all products, and occasionally do sponsored, non-review videos that highlight upgrades or crazy experiments using products provided from a given company. That’s just good marketing on both sides, and yes it will sell units, but it isn’t unfairly representing the product nor bashing a competitor.

For GN's part, I'm fine with them not being perfect and I think it's good even to have an understanding of their flaws and shortcomings. For your part, GN made it personal when they piled onto you with that tweet you did calling out LTT and they get to reap what they sow. So I think your reaction is fair, even if your conclusion is farther than where I would go.\n\nOn a side note, the comments section of this video are kinda depressing.

Not ""give him a chance to respond"" but just as a courtesy, because it ultimately looks like his motivations are to try and crowd out another tech reviewer.\n\nAnd I too am sick of all the sponsored stuff on YT. I  understand it is how these folks make a living, but it always felt scummy to me.', 'I think you make a great point. I have always felt that Linus and other big tech channels use their ""credibility"" to allow these obviously humongous conflicts of interest to just skate by. Let\'s not forget the ""Intel spends $5000 dollars per  each one of our employees for massive tech upgrades"" B.S. How is that allowable? Even though I believe Linus and others try not to allow these sponsorships to affect their judgement, it will.  I even once called out a certain aussie who I think does the best benchmarks in the biz, i told him in an email that I felt one of his ad spots appeared as a review and felt misleading and he bit my head off. I think you can\'t stay objective taking money from people you do reviews on. I had a realllly hard time with this my self. I could have made BANK off of sponsorships in my days as a youtuber and I rarely allowed my self to capitalize because I felt icky every time I did it. The worst part is the lion\'s share of viewers and fanboys won\'t understand or care about this, they put too much faith in these ""tech gods""...  Good video, glad you did it.', 'Hey !

It was just feeding the petty drama. I have no loyalty to anyone, but I do agree the 1060 was fair because it is still one of the most popular cards according to steam hardware data and many users will skip generations between upgrades (shit I\'m skipping two) and the older games are again, points of reference for a wide audience that has lots of experience with those titles and they have high play rates. \n\nThe only thing I would be concerned about is the SA allegation which they have said the right words about: its serious, they haven\'t discredited the accuser in any way, have hired a third party investigator and will be posting their results publicly. Within a couple days of the allegation (lightspeed for a medium size business)\n\nI don\'t really fuckin care about these semantic, nitpicking arguments. I don\'t think the fraud argument is fair either, they clearly divest themselves from their sponsored content, and you sponsoring cd key sites (which I approve of, I love g2play) is a good example of ""we can still be independent and do what needs doing to keep the lights on.""\n\nFurther, I just never understood the greed. Linus said he was offered 100 million for lmg. Why would anyone continue to stress with a community as toxic and hateful as PC enthusiasts unless they were either lying (which seems doubtful) or genuinely cared.\n\n God knows I wouldn\'t be a paramedic if I was offered 100 million, if I wasn\'t insanely passionate about helping people, because half the time my patients hate me for helping.\n\nThis just felt petty and semantic and didn\'t add anything of value to the situation. I think gamers nexus has also been petty in letting a drama unfold that was never going to impact their fan base over a stupid comment linus made in a video nobody would remember in a week.\n\nThe biggest thing that pisses me off is that you all seem to not care about the SA claim at all. You\'re all too sucked into this pathetic little pissing contest and it\'s burying the thing that actually relates to the possibility of a human being that was allegedly assaulted. But sure. Nitpick definitions, semantics, and dig up a conspiratorial web of details as you all dig in your heels like petulant children.\n\nThere\'s a reason I don\'t consider myself a part of this community. You guys are almost as awful as the guitar building community. At least the fountain pen community is  just a bunch of super sweet and friendly old people who play with inks and write each other as pen pals.', 'I got tired of GN a long time ago. But, their opinion is allowed to change.', 'This should have more views!', 'I completely agree with you on this.', ""Good job, despite the groupies who just can't watch a whole video and make their own opinion.

Ide like to see GN subscribers 2 weeks ago vs today.  Any publicity, is publicity.  Whether people agree or disagree.  Anyone who sees the extremely detailed and planned attack on LMG as anything but a power grab is deaf, dumb, or blind.  This coming a few months after Linus posts a video stating he will be stepping away.  Clearly they have issues, and they knew that before GN decided to take a shot below the belt.  What irritates me isnt the position GN took.  Its the way they projected the content in holier than thou fashion as if they have not made mistakes.  However we can be sure that they scoured their content and removed any mistakes in graphs, information, and general error that may have taken place in the past.   Funny how that works.  Again, i dont disagree with points made.   I have thought for quite some time that Linus has, for lacking of better words, exceeded his capacity.  Personally, I watch Linus for entertainment.  I never really could get into GN content.  Not because its false or incorrect, but because its one big dramafest.  Take the AMD fiasco for example involving the voltage issue.  How many videos can be released about one topic of a guy standing in front of a camera screaming ""neiner neiner neiner"".  Its annoying tbh.  The pot calls the kettle black.

I\'d say it\'s ESPECIALLY important to call out those we like and appreciate, actually.  I\'m sure this is a giant whirlwind for Linus and emotions are running high.  Though his response statement to/about GN is thoroughly structured and fluently ""wordy"", his opinions and decisions outlined therein are, unfortunately, rooted in knee-jerk emotional reactions.   Some of these emotions are fear (fear of the bad press, fear of not having a sense of direction to move through this situation) and a lot of bruised ego (maybe feeling betrayed by those he may have otherwise felt were peers and by extension a presumed predisposition on stuff like this should it ever occur (wishing Steve would have contacted him first) and really strongly inferring that Steve SHOULD have done so in his opinion; hurt because the tech community INCLUDING other content creators is the life and world he loves so yeah this stings; humiliated because he\'s been in tech his entire life and the wealth of experience gained creates a false sense of infallibility); all of this just leads to some kind of a protestant impulse response, which, logic from an outside person such as the audience or other creators weighing in on the issue can easily do the math and conclude it\'s inappropriate.  I know Linus\' intentions overall of what he wants to bring to the community are genuine, and I know everyone else\'s are, too (HWUnboxed, GN, etc.).

Progress brought I A and the GPT chat, replacing the inability of those without a gift to create news and that\'s a good thing, because before history recorded that those without the ability to think from different angles condemned intelligent people, and with a vision totally opposite to theirs contemporary contemporaries, the loss of civil rights, or the stake, then social banishment.

My country still has a long way to go, but I wouldn\'t blame the local talent either. These people are as bright if not brighter than their foreign working counterparts. My country is crippled educationally by an outdated system. Most of the talent you see in your country is exactly that, talent that managed to filter through a very broken system (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Smt. Smriti Hirani has done a lot to improve education till high school but college education remains as is). When people such as Steve Wozniak and yourself call us unimaginative that is because we are. We fight for our lives rote learning semester upon semester (my IITians can disagree, but then again, they spend millions of dollars in tax payer\'s money to learn from the brightest minds only to quit upon the country) just to get a menial job because the teachers aren\'t interested in teaching, nor is the broader college level board. The few in this system who take it upon themselves to learn their craft thrive in their respective market regardless of the country, profession, and imagination skills, because as you said, they possess skills more suited towards realizing something.\n\n I am not jealous of USA\'s education system, I am glad that it exists, because its focus on hands on training and openness to students posing fundamental questions is what attracts us Indians initially. I\'ve learnt enough mathematics to know that, asymptotically, your most efficient performance is only ever dependent on your worst-case scenarios. Until we refine the education system to make mathematics and the sciences an enjoyable journey in schools and colleges, we will have the brain drain. When the bulk of the population becomes educated, it would be harder to fly to foreign countries when you\'d have a lot more of these ""unimaginative, skilled but focused"" workers in the homeland. One thing I know for sure is that India is a true democracy, it lives by the motto of live and let live. If the Indian semiconductor market somehow survives, it would be for the benefit of the entire world. ISRO\'s cheaper than a sci-fi flick lunar and mars missions have proven this. \n\ntldr: local talent ain\'t noncompetent, it\'s just not rightly trained. India\'s semiconductor business will only improve from homegrown efforts, funded by the minds of Indian talent from a better education system than we have today at a college level.

What they do is to mock the person, give him all sorts of social headaches.They dont want someone to be different or go beyond their reach. People will social boycott you, talk bad about you, damage your reputation etc etc. Indians are mostly very closely associated with the society. Most cant survive alone. So most people dont have the gutts to go against everyone and prove your point. You wont have friends, if you do they will mock you at every possible situation, you wont be able to find love or matches for arranged marriages. Because even if you have millions of $ in future potential, they will see someone earning 100k INR P.M ( ~1250$) as a better suitor. I have personally faced all these for the last decade and I did shutdown everyone due to the toxicity and work alone. I dont usually go to any social gatherings or have anyone to talk with. The peer pressure is enormous. Im 28 rn and if i bump on an old friend by accident, the first question I will be asked is if I have married !. When I said Not yet, I could see the smile in his face and he said he got married. To give you some perspective that old friend is earning 200$ per month being a delivery executive and I design embedded computers and displays.  \nI scored 94% at high school, studied at a top university in India and dropped out and then went to Europe to continue my studies and then dropped again to start my entrepreneurial journey.  There has been 1000s of instances when i almost lost my energy and thought why Indians just leave this place for better opportunities. People will treat you well if you are in a foreign country or have a government job or earn around 100k INR per month. Its all money and power in the eyes of an average Indian. Talent is just trashed left and right. Your talent is useless to them until you earn buttloads of money. So that they will que up to get in touch with you.   Not everyone has the iron will to suffer through this and come out successful. For the brain drain to end, India must first learn to respect the knowledgeable people and stop respecting the goons and politicians.

Alternatively, you truly believe that anytime someone is sponsered by a company and review their product, regardless of test results, there is a conflict of interest. To that extent, you could argue anyone with brand loyalty, regardless of sponsership, has a conflict of interest. \n\nAnyway, your argument against Gamers Nexus is pretty weak in my opinion.

Within a couple days of the allegation (lightspeed for a medium size business)\n\nI don\'t really fuckin care about these semantic, nitpicking arguments. I don\'t think the fraud argument is fair either, they clearly divest themselves from their sponsored content, and you sponsoring cd key sites (which I approve of, I love g2play) is a good example of ""we can still be independent and do what needs doing to keep the lights on.""\n\nFurther, I just never understood the greed. Linus said he was offered 100 million for lmg.

We are in the time when people are on the net, they don\'t interact live, they are critical for youtuber but not for reality. Great innovations such as the creation of cloned sheep, plagiarism of a work, imitation of a natural talent, copying what already exists, have been new. History will tell.

And that\'s why the fallen angels rebelled because they wanted to be like men, free and freed and they hate our condition of (free) being GOD\'s Maximum Work. Progress brought I A and the GPT chat, replacing the inability of those without a gift to create news and that\'s a good thing, because before history recorded that those without the ability to think from different angles condemned intelligent people, and with a vision totally opposite to theirs contemporary contemporaries, the loss of civil rights, or the stake, then social banishment.

No, they couldn\'t have.  If you have a company like LMG, you don\'t have ONLY technical people there.  They\'ve featured one of their secretaries on segments where they\'ve tested large PC sellers\' customer support specifically BECAUSE she is so non-technical.  This may be a shock to you, but there are people out there who have NO IDEA what any given graphics card can and cannot do, let alone see that a bar graph for, what to them, look like a bunch of random letter and number designations, looks off.  But those people are likely the ones who are tasked with taking the raw data from the lab and importing it into Excel or whatever and making a pretty bar graph out of it. They WON\'T know.  Your criticism might apply to your own situation if everyone you work with is fairly tech-y, but that absolutely will no longer apply to a 100+ person company.  \n\n\nThere\'s a big hump when a company goes over 100 people that I\'ve been able to observe personally 3 or 4 times in my career, where it stops being a big family and not everyone is personally invested in the success of the company, anymore, it\'s just a place they work.  So procedures have to be formalized and safeguards have to be put in place that weren\'t necessary before.  (This is also the point where the honor system snack shelf has to be replaced with a vending machine. That may seem trite, but it\'s a good example of what goes on at all levels when you\'re crossing that threshold.)  If a company fails to ""grow up"" at this point, it can actually destroy the company, so if LMG wants to continue to succeed, they\'d better get this right.', 'This is why I like guys like you Vex, Jayztwocents, Hardware Unboxed, GamersNexus, Ancient Gameplays, and even Greg Salazar. Honestly, LTT lost me a while back because of the fact they sounded like corporate swindlers hocking their brand, and shilling for whoever could give them a fat paycheck.', ""It's a YouTube channel....

My country still has a long way to go, but I wouldn\'t blame the local talent either. These people are as bright if not brighter than their foreign working counterparts. My country is crippled educationally by an outdated system. Most of the talent you see in your country is exactly that, talent that managed to filter through a very broken system (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Smt. Smriti Hirani has done a lot to improve education till high school but college education remains as is). When people such as Steve Wozniak and yourself call us unimaginative that is because we are. We fight for our lives rote learning semester upon semester (my IITians can disagree, but then again, they spend millions of dollars in tax payer\'s money to learn from the brightest minds only to quit upon the country) just to get a menial job because the teachers aren\'t interested in teaching, nor is the broader college level board. The few in this system who take it upon themselves to learn their craft thrive in their respective market regardless of the country, profession, and imagination skills, because as you said, they possess skills more suited towards realizing something.\n\n I am not jealous of USA\'s education system, I am glad that it exists, because its focus on hands on training and openness to students posing fundamental questions is what attracts us Indians initially. I\'ve learnt enough mathematics to know that, asymptotically, your most efficient performance is only ever dependent on your worst-case scenarios. Until we refine the education system to make mathematics and the sciences an enjoyable journey in schools and colleges, we will have the brain drain. When the bulk of the population becomes educated, it would be harder to fly to foreign countries when you\'d have a lot more of these ""unimaginative, skilled but focused"" workers in the homeland. One thing I know for sure is that India is a true democracy, it lives by the motto of live and let live. If the Indian semiconductor market somehow survives, it would be for the benefit of the entire world. ISRO\'s cheaper than a sci-fi flick lunar and mars missions have proven this. \n\ntldr: local talent ain\'t noncompetent, it\'s just not rightly trained. India\'s semiconductor business will only improve from homegrown efforts, funded by the minds of Indian talent from a better education system than we have today at a college level. Improving Indian business means improvement in the international pipeline for trade and commerce.

What they do is to mock the person, give him all sorts of social headaches.They dont want someone to be different or go beyond their reach.

And the dragon gave the beast his own power and throne and great authority.\n\n\n3 I saw that one of the heads of the beast seemed wounded beyond recovery—but the fatal wound was healed! The whole world marveled at this miracle and gave allegiance to the beast. 4 They worshiped the dragon for giving the beast such power, and they also worshiped the beast. “Who is as great as the beast?” they exclaimed. “Who is able to fight against him?”\n\n5 Then the beast was allowed to speak great blasphemies against God. And he was given authority to do whatever he wanted for forty-two months. 6 And he spoke terrible words of blasphemy against God, slandering his name and his dwelling—that is, those who dwell in heaven.[a] 7 And the beast was allowed to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And he was given authority to rule over every tribe and people and language and nation. 8 And all the people who belong to this world worshiped the beast. They are the ones whose names were not written in the Book of Life that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered before the world was made.[b]\n\n9 \nAnyone with ears to hear\n    should listen and understand.\n10 \nAnyone who is destined for prison\n    will be taken to prison.\nAnyone destined to die by the sword\n    will die by the sword.\n\nThis means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.\nThe Beast out of the Earth\n\n11 Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke with the voice of a dragon. 12 He exercised all the authority of the first beast. And he required all the earth and its people to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 13 He did astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky while everyone was watching. 14 And with all the miracles he was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast, he deceived all the people who belong to this world. He ordered the people to make a great statue of the first beast, who was fatally wounded and then came back to life. 15 He was then permitted to give life to this statue so that it could speak. Then the statue of the beast commanded that anyone refusing to worship it must die.\n\n16 He required everyone—small and great, rich and poor, free and slave—to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead. 17 And no one could buy or sell anything without that mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name. 18 Wisdom is needed here.

The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead and walking in the newness of life. That's what Acts 2:38 is. \r\nWe can't pick and choose which scriptures we like or dislike. We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOTH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT for a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter the kingdom of GOD. \r\nJesus Christ does love us and died for us, and he wants us to obey him. We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. \r\nOur salvation must match the scriptures, and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. Eternity is TOO long to be WRONG! \r\nThe gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. \r\nIt's better to walk alone than with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone. Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS, and the other is a WORK OF FAITH or OBEDIENCE TO GOD. Noah believed or had FAITH, BUT THEN WORKED OR OBEYED TO BUILD THE ARK TO BE SAVED. LOT believed or had FAITH, BUT THEN OBEYED AND LEFT SODOM. This is why Jesus said,  He who believes and is baptized shall be saved. We must believe and obey Acts 2:38.

Once it was discovered that the content was inaccurate, Linus blamed Hardware Unboxe,d and Gamers Nexus of the same errors, and that as Content Creator Bros, they shouldn't be throwing other content creators under the bus.  Really? And, LTT was supposed to return the hardware after reviewing it and instead auctioned it off at the LTX Expo.  So, the other issue besides technical errors is that Linus blamed everyone but himself.

If the individual consumer doesn’t do thorough homework and makes a bad purchasing decision based off their videos that is on that consumer.

They introduce innovation in the sense that they get ideas into the mainstream and they do set a lot of trends that other companies copy. Apple also copies from other companies or buys startups with good ideas that they can develop. They unapologetically break from legacy tech that can really be a nightmare for professionals who value stability and compatibility over change. Their aggressive changes also help push the industry forward into adopting new technologies at a more rapid pace. They excel in a lot of industrial design and build quality. Their upgrades are usually significantly overpriced and their entry level models are too expensive for budget consumers and the entry Macs are generally unpowered for the cost to push users to the overpriced upgrades. They also provide long support cycles with a strong,  free OS across their lineup. They have a lack of flexibility and freedom for those who like to significantly customize and modify their OS functions, outside of macOS. They also have excellent compatibility and interoperability within their ecosystem and that can be a huge benefit to many consumers and even more advanced users who want a more turn key solution. \n\nThere are lots of pros and cons to Apple and their products. They are different from other tech companies in significant ways that are both good and bad depending on your needs. They are very effective at marketing, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have real value just because they sell it so well, or with so much hyperbole. Fanboys and haters will keep doing their thing, but honestly? Why not just enjoy the good things and let others enjoy what they enjoy, instead of “ACSHHHUUUAALLLLY”—ing everywhere on the internet?

That super fancy expensive Apple HQ facility will be closed and abandoned in the next few years, mark my words. \n\nThere is a huge shift in the markets coming, and it's not good for anyone. Commercial real estate market is about to burst, and the rich are going to pin the issue on the government and poor people. Forcing a huge tax bailout that these scum billionaires hardly contributed pennies to, just like with the 2008 housing market crash. The rich and powerful have seen what a crash does when a large economy relies on these industries, and they can just get free massive payouts, with zero legal repercussions. \n\nI know this seems like a stretch, but these sings are pretty clear of a major market crash.

Winding them side by side like this doesn't give a positive lock, just a side by side lock which on an unwound string is just asking for slippage.\nIf it takes 1 second more to remove them who cares?\nI've been on stage for 57 years so I've tried everything and that works best."", 'Nut slots not included on a basic set up?

He's also making it seem so hard to undo, when I can undo it in the same time as a straight string. The reason for using a Gibson knot is you can break in a string very quickly before a performance. You can get by with minimal wraps around the post. It's very quick and secure if you know what you're doing. This guy just has a messiah complex and thinks it's only his way that works."", ""Guilty as charged for leaving oil on the neck too long.

Back it up maybe a post-and-a-half\'s worth. Bend the excess toward the middle of the headstock. Wind the string down like a coil (the lower on the post the string, the tighter against the nut it will be). Then bend the excess string back and forth until it breaks off cleanly. No need for clippers. No stickers to nail your fingers. However, you have to twice overwrap the string-through on the 1st and 2nd strings, otherwise, when you break off the strings, they will slip on the posts.\nTrust me. You will love having no stickers to draw blood. By bending the excess string toward the middle of the headstock, you form an ""S"" through the post, adding to a tight fit.

It refers to the striking and killing of living beings. Taking life is the will to kill anything that one perceives as having life, to act so as to terminate the life-force in it, in so far as the will finds expression in bodily action or in speech. With regard to animals it is worse to kill large ones than small. Because a more extensive effort is involved. Even where the effort is the same, the difference in substance must be considered.\nIn the case of humans the killing is the more blameworthy the more virtuous they are. Apart from that, the extent of the offense is proportionate to the intensity of the wish to kill. Five factors are involved: a living being, the perception of a living being, a thought of murder, the action of carrying it out, and death as a result of it. And six are the ways in which the offense may be carried out: with one’s own hand\nPlease Don't Kill Them....They Are So Good And Kind Animals...Everyone Has Right To Live On This Earth...Please It's Request...I Literally Cried After Watching This...Please Don't Kill"", 'A szakszerüségeket akarom làtni./officinàlis/', 'Mi a faszt csinàlnak vele ?', 'Nem akarok undormànyokat làtni a you Toubon.', '🏚️💐🍶', 'TORTURA STOKE😢', 'How sad and tragic this is😢', 'Capitalism', 'Warum muss denn so was sein, warum lässt man der Natur nicht seinen Lauf.', 'Хотя бы говно смыли с молока приемника перед съемками,а то кадр весь испортился)))', ""To be absolutely honest I love 🐄 but I don't like milk or say right it's not my fav meals however I like cheese LoL 😅"", 'Please keep the machines out of the farms', 'Clickbait', ""Perverse....

I think that metal rods were casted and built into a rig where these pieces could fit onto with a hole in the center, and then spinned with another metal object or rocks used to lathe the pieces. The stones are heavy but 4-5 men could lift one around enough to work on it. Or they were sat onto a spinning rod and used an object on the side to shape the rock while having water poured on it.  I think we may need to look into how exactly were they spinning the lathe to determine if it was great technology or just manual labor.', 'Wow!  And tney had these machine tools 900 yrs ago?  Amazing!  But what devices held these bits?  How were they powered and are any of them waiting in places yet to be found.  Thank you for shining light into things unknown by most modern people.', 'As a machinist, this is amazing to see! I do all manual machining and am a toolmaker, so here\'s a few comments. The turned pillars look like a lot of fun to make, I\'ve done the same thing to countless pieces of steel, just a lot smaller, but it\'s the same thing. Those marks you point out in the beginning are what happens when you create a contour on a lathe by hand. You can only move the tool on  a lathe in the X and Y axis (right/left and in/out), so in order to create this feature you have to precisely move the tool in and over at the same time, both of which are done with a separate hand wheel on a modern lathe. It\'s not a perfect operation which is why the surface finish (grooves) are worse in those contoured areas. The evenly divided features around their perimeter, and the cuts along their length is much harder to make than the fact that it was turned.  Unless they\'re hand carved, with precision layouts. That\'s something seldomly considered. If I had no machines, I could still use my knowledge and do a precision layout on the work, and then use hand tools to remove the material slowly. And you can do very precise layouts in surprisingly simple ways, ways that even the modern machinists of today have already forgotten. Unfortunately, it\'s always that way and even a lot of what I know hasn\'t been done in a very long time, and is now forgotten. Gears can easily be made by hand, and they were done that way for a long time before they were cut on machines. Just like one who truly seeks God will certainly find enlightenment, one that seeks how to make two things move together will eventually connect them with a belt. And when considering how to make one move 1/2 as fast as the other, while they\'re connected by a belt... If given a little stone or sand drawing of the problem, and a few evenings of contemplation and ancient wine, they will surely discover that making one 1/2 as big would accomplish the goal. Within ourselves is most of these answers, and I believe we are much more capable as humans than we imagine, which is why most of these things seem so impossible. But knowing what these tool marks are and being able to imagine how it may have been done, I think only makes it seem MORE amazing. I wish I could quit my job and go be Praveen\'s sidekick... bringing along a bag of calipers, micrometers, indicators, reference tools, and other metrology equipment. There is so much to be measured, and I\'m sure there are mysteries that wait to be discovered within the micro detail. For instance if we knew they could maintain a precise diameter over the entire column, in other words it\'s the same size at the top as the bottom, to say within .005"" or .010"" , then we\'d know the accuracy of their machines, and that would be incredible accuracy for such a large pillar. But say it measured to within .0005 or better, then that would be a whole different thing, and there might be aliens...just sayin.', 'Stup!d modern academe chisels and hammers your !d!otic ass.\nThat is a product of a lathe machine.', ""I've always believed today's civilization is primitive as compared to ancient people in terms of understanding the universe and it's hidden secrets of energy, vibration and frequency."", ""I visited these temples in Karnataka back around 1990 and at the time I saw that the columns had been lathe turned. It's pretty evident that some ingenious apparatus would have been needed. Likewise the fine stone filigree work is fascinating. However, to posit that this is mysterious since the humans in that area and time were 'primitive' reminds me a lot of the huge, olympian leaps of logic promoted by folks like Von Daniken. I think human ingenuity has existed far longer than our recent sense of history. Just because we see the past through modern filters (and a questionable sense that we have 'evolved' or 'progressed') and cannot personally understand how something was done doesn't mean that it was impossible for 'primitives'.\n\nThe filigree carving and hollowing of stone (and relatively soft stone, from what I was told it's a variety of soapstone) is not without practice within the last few hundred years. I saw curios at the National Palace Museum in Taipei that showed similar levels of craftsmanship- jadeite and nephrite carved into nesting, movable spheres, or into lace like structures finer than that seen in the temples. Of course the scale was completely different- jewelry vs architechtural  detailing. I asked a curator and was told it was done using wood, copper, and bronze tools with an abrasive slurry and water. I think the wood was used with fine polishing powders to give the piece a gloss polish.\n\nI have carved stone using a scrap of copper wire, a simple drill (the old chinese craftsmen used small bow drills) and aluminum oxide powder. Soft stone can be carved this way using hard quartz sand. Likewise, John Dobson made huge telescope mirrors to high precision  using materials found in a gardner's shed- hard sand as abrasive, mixed with water and timed to settle out larger from smaller grain sizes  so he could use coarse to very fine grinding sessions. The material was salvaged thick disks of glass from ship portholes, which he turned into large amateur telescopes-the Dobsonian.\n\nMy point is there is always a way, even if at first glance it might seem impossible.\n\nI have a thought experiment that is of course not backed with proof, but consider it a possible explaination other than Aliens with tractor beams and defrappolating pistols:\n1) A deep pit is dug, with provision for filling and draining water. The ground, if too porous to contain water, could be sealed with bentonite clay as is done for farm ponds. Perhaps something like a well.\n2) A large timber cylinder, with a socket carved into its bottom center, is lowered and settled into the pit and onto a stone block fitted with a pin that mates to the socket of the timber cylinder.\n3) A block of stone is moved into position and affixed to the upper end of the timber cylinder. Metal stakes driven into the end of the timber could be used to fit into sockets carved into the stone block. This block is roughly carved into a cylinder before being mounted to the timber.\n4) The pit is flooded with enough water to pick up the weight of the stone. \n5) The timber post float with the stone block is rotated, using a rope capstan type drive. Think the scale of Roman siege engines.\n6) Bronze bars of various shapes are pushed against the rotating stone, while being fed a slurry of crushed quartz. As the surface progresses this is replaced with sand. The support structure for these bars must be fixed to the surrounding ground as it must be relatively stationary while the stone block is turning.\n7) The upper part of the timber is kept steady with logs crossing the mouth of the pit and bearing lightly against the turning timber float, like a steady rest on a lathe. This keeps the work from moving off center. Lubrication is by beeswax at the points of contact of the steady logs and the timber float.\n\nNow, keep in mind that the silliness above assumes the pillars are single pieces of stone. They may actually be segmented and joined with a color matched mortar; the extreme fluted designs would make it hard to tell. If so the mass of the stone block blank would be that much lower.\n\nIn fact, unless these pillars have been deconstructed to prove otherwise they could have been made using a much simpler apparatus much like a large potter's wheel on dry land and simply pinned and mortared together. It would not be difficult to formulate a colored mortar that would make the joint hard to see, and it could also be lapped and polished with a rope to further refine the surface of the join. If they are pinned they don't even have to be mortared- the joint could be covered with stone dust and wax.\n\nReally, we need to respect the intelligence and ingenuity of these ancients. Just because Von Daniken couldn't figure out how the pyramids were made doesn't mean human genius in the past couldn't. In any field there are techniques that are astonishing to those outside looking in. Honestly, while I can't do it there were people that could make an intricate chronometer mechanism out of brass hundreds of years ago. People still do it today, and with the simplest of machines.

However, suspend your biases for just a second and analyze Noah’s flood theory in the Bible for just a second. According to the Bible, people before the flood lived much longer than today. The scripture shows that people's lifespans decreased rapidly in the centuries following the flood. This likely meant that people aged slower: a 50-year-old might be equivalent to a teenager. Analyzing the generations from Adam to Noah, we see a rapid technological increase. Within seven generations of Cain (generation 2), his descendants (generation 9) were using Bronze and Iron instruments, according to Genesis 4:18-22. The iron age started in 1200 BC; however, the flood that destroyed all of Cain’s descendants occurred around 5000 BC. Thus an earlier pre-flood generation was technologically superior to a post-flood generation. It is possible that humans had access to technologies that we could not even fathom before the flood. After the earth was catastrophically depopulated, the survivors had to start civilizations over again with much shorter lifespans. Technology was lost and needed to be rediscovered. We see this happen in later times. After the fall of Rome, people forgot how to make concrete. Literacy rates decreased rapidly during the dark ages. Who is to say this didn't happen in a post-flood world? Furthermore, some of the discrepancies in technology among the Egyptians, where some artifacts are very advanced while others from the same time period are very primitive, could show that these advanced technologies come from an earlier time period before the flood. The technology could have been rediscovered among the ruins left by the flood. \n\r\nFurthermore, writing officially started in 3400 BC in Ancient Mesopotamia, years after the flood. How can scholars say 100% percent that the Bible narrative, which comes from God, who is eternal, is fake? If aliens are gaining traction, why can’t the existence of God from the Bible be at least analyzed objectively? Hundreds of civilizations from every continent have a flood narrative. They do not all align 100%, yet all say that a small group of people and animals survived the flood in a boat.

It is the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three (quoting IBM documentation there).  Pretty much all  ML  or what marketing calls ""AI""  uses Neural Nets.    \n\n 2)  The claim that Neural Nets simulate the way the brain works is rather strong, given that no one yet knows exactly how the brain does what it does - no one understands how neurons work.  Each  neuron in your brain has many thousands of connections.   There is NO ONE who knows all that neurons are doing with those, nor anyone who understands what is going on inside a human neuron.   So how can anyone but a marking department claim a neural network ""simulates"" what no one understands?   This doesn\'t mean that ML cannot simulate handing of input and output that obtains similar results that a human might, or do some things even better - but that doesn\'t mean it is simulating a human mind.   An old TI Calculator can do some Math a lot faster and more accurately than you can.   Does it mean it is thinking like a human brain?    We  know it\'\'s not.  \n\n 3)  The claim that  ""we don\'t always know how the system came up with that""  is also kind of a ""marketing"" thing,  in that programmers do know exactly what the code in a neural network is doing.  But they do use math like stochastic gradient descent, an algorithm which uses randomness in order to find a set of weights for mapping  from inputs to outputs for the training data.    Given the very large number of such ""neurons"" in  deep learning code -- while it is fully known how those are generated -- given the randomization,  no one can really ""know"" (or for marketing purposes ""understand"") how those are all set - (i.e. for example be able to to keep in mind the weights that all those are set to), thus the claim ""we don\'t know what its doing"".

As soon as they are old enough to begin creating an understanding of who they are, force them into a system that teaches them that it is wrong to be yourself if yourself is different from what is accepted as normal. Confuse them about their own biological makeup so that they think that permanently altering their body is the answer to happiness. Regain their daily attendance at an institution that makes them Focus only on the information that is provided. Make them attend the institution from age five until an adult and repeatedly test them on the information so that it becomes their truth. Give them an explanation to everything so that they never have a chance to make their own assumptions of the world. Scold them and humiliate them if they suggest an opinion that opposes that of their authoritives. Keep reminding them of how cruel their ancestors were to each other in the past and broadcast how cruel they are to each other in the present. Only show them tragedies on the news so they live in fear and think the worst of one another. Convince them that their species used to be that of a incontinent Wild animal. Make them think they're very existence is so incredibly random, that they lack purpose and struggle to make sense of a creator. Tell them they're kind is as smart as they've ever been so that they don't question the integrity of the system that they're in. Provide them with idols with artificial Beauty and use them as an example of what it is to look perfect so that they're never content with their own appearance and can't help but to compare themselves amongst each other. Create addictive digital platforms that rank them by numbers, so that they base their self-worth off of the amount of followers that they have and are never satisfied. Isolate them into a society around them in which who have money benefit and those who don't, fail. Make money the main focus but make it so difficult to accumulate, that they remain in a place of constant struggle, forced to dedicate the majority of their time to the system that made it this way. Tax them every way possible but tell them that it's for their own benefit so that they don't think twice about paying it. Take so much of their time and energy throughout the week but give them two days to themselves so they feel a sense of award and don't fight back. Promote the consumption of poison in every social setting so that even on those two days, they remain disconnected from themselves and each other. Pump their food with access sugars and addictive chemicals but make it cheap and advertised and easily accessible so that they never stop consuming. When their food makes them ill, prescribe them with meds that only mask the symptoms so they become dependent on it every day. Charge them so much money for healthcare so that they stay in a consistent Loop of consuming, medicating and working. Cause chaos amongst them and blame it on a group of Their Own so they form judgmental stereotypes. Turn them against each other in so many ways so that even if they were to connect on one, they would still be divided on another. .....

Trong một khía cạnh nhỏ, Nhân Quả nghĩa là chúng sanh gieo Nhân nào sẽ gặt Quả đó, không thể nào lẩn tránh được. Luân hồi nghĩa là chúng sanh không phải chỉ có một kiếp hiện tại mà đã và sẽ sinh ra, chết đi vô lượng kiếp dưới nhiều xác thân khác nhau và luật Nhân Quả luôn theo sát quá trình Luân hồi đó.  Một kiếp của một người so với vô lượng kiếp của người đó giống như một hạt cát trong sa mạc và Nhân Quả luôn chi phối chặt chẽ quá trình này. Muốn giải thoát khỏi Luân hồi sinh tử chỉ có một con đường tu tập theo sự chỉ dạy của Phật. Con đường giải thoát là khách quan, có sẵn không lệ thuộc vào Phật. Phật chỉ là người đi trước, đã thành công và giải thoát. Vì vậy mọi chúng sanh đều có thể đi theo con đường của Phật để tự giải thoát và thành Phật, như Phật đã nói ""Như mặn là vị của nước biển, còn vị của đạo ta là giải thoát""', 'Nice 🔥', 'Fantastic collection', 'А в паРаше навоз в тазах развозят безмозглые упыри.', 'Задовільна оцінка це трійка по пятибальній системі!

Les aides à la conduites : je n’ai pas pris la totale car ça dépassait les 47 000€ même avec ristourne. Le pack complet n’apporte que la vision 3D, le rétro caméra et l’anti collusion arrière. On peut s’en passer même si je voulais l’avoir. Une option que je trouve hyper importante : les pneus anti crevaison. Pourquoi ? Ces pneus sont auto cicatrisants. J’en ai fait l’expérience. J’ai découvert cette fonction en allant chez Renault. Évidemment je n’avais pas enlevé le boulon. Le gars de Renault me dit écoutez. Il enlève le boulon et ça fait pschit. Et terminé, le pneu ne se dégonfle pas et est cicatrisé. Après côté tarif attention. Une voiture moins chère n’entraîne pas une baisse des mensualités en LOA. J’était parti sur une techno et c’était plus cher. Dernière chose. Tout ce qui n’est pas attaché au véhicule ne rentre pas dans le calcul du bonus.

Its the Nigerian court that taught inec how to hand pick or select someone for a position. You listed the case of Uzodinma, akpabio and Lawal. Inec is another body thats jump into that train. You see this two body, ince and judiciary, they are the CORE problem of Nigeria. They are the main reasons Nigerians are oppressed by the elite. A good reform of this two, will remove first, oppression of the elite against the ordinary Nigerians.\nMy questions is: Why should the same inec be planning of conducting an off season election, when their hands are marred with court cases? Nigerians MUST NOT allow this', 'Was there ANY provision for electronic collation in the electoral Act or Electoral Guideline 2023?', 'Inec, 👉you are wrong. !', 'Kindergarten nation', 'In a civilized nation, Yakubu Mahmood should have been in prison by now.', 'It is very wrong to base electing a president for Nigeria on sentiment or sympathy, or  mandate snatched from the winner because his tribes men are not submissive to a particular tribe. According  to the comment by davidmalonti7464  above, Igbos will only be considered by other tribes, to become the president of Nigeria if and only when they have accepted to worship other tribes. Which means Nigeria is not concerned with supporting and electing the best candidate who will fix and make Nigeria better for the benefit  of the country and the citizens but one who will bow and take orders from other tribes no matter how bad he is. Well, until some people seize to feel to be more Nigerian than other Nigerians, there is no possibility or hope for a one and better Nation. Not ever !', 'Thank you, Dr Sam, for this input. People like you give hope to millions of Nigerians who have lost confidence in the country currently ruled by criminals.\nThe INEC chairman and all its staff must be punished else, there will not be any lesson to learn. And all those that contributed to this shame called 2023 elections must be made to face the music.', 'Call a spade a spade.\nNothing wrong with the electoral laws.\nINEC simply aided and abetted a civilian coup by APC on election day.

The only solution is to take away the appointment of Inec chairman the president. That is the only way to ensure neutrality of INEC. Today it is Obi that is robbed, tomorrow it will be another person. Those who cannot think beyond ethnic sentiment should know that Nigeria is bigger than one tribe or religion."", 'There\'s need to remove all ambiguities pertaining to conduct of elections in the electoral law. For example; the discretionary powers (already affirmed by the High Court and Appeal Court) that states that INEC has wide range of powers to conduct election in any manner it deems fit leaves room for INEC to manipulate its guidelines, rules and regulations for conduct of elections. Methinks, that this is the lacuna that APC and INEC exploited to bypass the BVAS and IRev on transmission of election results in real time. Of course, the claim of technical glitch by INEC was a natural sequence to downplay the importance of iRev; thus maintain the chain of falsehoods. Furthermore, what is ""transmit"" or ""transfer"" in the electoral law? Must be clearly defined.\n\nFinally, INEC under Prof Mahmoud Yakubu must be unbundled and a comprehensive independent audit conducted.', 'Cry cry everywhere', 'This man is the personification of Professor Nwabueze. I salute him for this analysis', 'Sam Amadi is a blessing 🙌 🙏 ✨️ 💖', 'We need to also critically look at the role of INEC in not only being Election Manager but also the regulator of Political Parties Activities and the behaviour of politicians and functionaries.

Secondly,  all INEC officials should be prosecuted and jailed.', 'We should be bold enough to call a spade a spade, the problem we have in this country is inec and who chairs it ,if you have am umpire who worships money what do you expect, inec continues to recycle criminals in Nigeria which everyone knows, if we need a real change and good governance, tinubu ,inec chairman and everyone who stole people mandate suppose to be in jail else we are not serious we are only good in speaking English like this man', 'A New Nigeria is sure,we must reclaim our stolen mandate', '👏👏👏', ""Court should be courageous enough to sack Tinubu otherwise he'll sack them tomorrow just like the failure of Bawa,EFCC chairman to prosecute Tinubu and now he's prosecuting him now.All eyes on judiciary and u guys must save Nigeria 🇳🇬 from this propagandists."", 'Uncle Sam, God bless you', ""Everyone knows that the election wasn't credible,and was totally flawed so what's the court still waiting for to sack this tinubu...what sort of country is this..."", 'Igbo people are the most brilliant intelligent set of people in Africa.', 'I wonder what the INEC chairman is still doing there.', 'Nigeria is a criminal enterprise', 'I think Nigerians talk too much and do less, Nigerians confusing theirselves with English,..,where were  all this people before now  and before installation of Tinubu??', 'Well said. .. hope any confused judge listens and learns', 'Great presentation?\n\nBut why is there no campaign for INEC chairman to resign?

You were so confident in the opinion polls, you threw caution to the wind, insulted Northerners, Insulted Niger Delta’, tagged everyone from South-west Afonja’s which literally meant betrayers, called them Agbadorians, called Tinubu unprintable names, the only political leader to give an Igbo man Commissioner in Lagos, ie Ben Akabueze, . \n\nI kept saying then that you guys need to humble yourselves, the truth is OBI could have been in Aso Rock today but Pride Goes before Fall.\n\nYour continuous bashing of Tinubu won him the sympathy of other people, your unbridled arrogance repelled majority of the undecided voters. \n\nDele Farotimi joined in the barrage of insults and mud-slinging. \n\nYou lost it all, even Atiku beat your candidate despite the fact that 5 Governors worked against him, that was absolutely shameful .\n\nNow there is another opportunity in 4 years time, go back to your Sunday meetings and advise your people to HUMBLE THEMSELVES SO GOD WILL LIFT YOU UP.

You should not have accepted to speak on an issue that is still in court. All evidence of the case and witnesses have been presented in court and the judges are deliberating on them. There is no amount of assumption from the outside that would influence what presented to the judges. Where they are in doubt of any alleged technical glitch or issues they know where to go to get the truth. It is being alleged on this presentation that you have exposed INEC which definitely not true because you are not an expert in technology. The bottom line as I have advised you should have excused yourself for your own integrity for matters that are already in court. Should the court see otherwise from your prospective, you would have made a fool out of yourself unless you have special interest in this matter. Comments are direct to Mr. SAm Amadi.', 'Well said Prof. God bless and protect you', ""Oga scholar pls allow the Judiciary to do their work.......\nElectoral petitions are in court.\nYou don't pre empt the court.😂😂😂"", 'INEC should be labeled the coup army for Democracy.

Many politicians in Africa expecially in Nigeria don't care about their citizens wellbeing.

For Africa to make any meaninful progress, our leaders need to change their mentality."", ""INEC already knew who their winner was and were dead set on declaring him president regardless of the real outcome of the elections. If they are allowed to get away with it this time I don't see what stops them from doing it next time. Server failure is a very convenient excuse to throw up whenever you want to justify a sham process. Tinubu remains an illegitimate president no matter what happens at the tribunal. He is a product of a sham process. He is lucky to be living in a country with some of the most docile citizens you can find anywhere in the world that's why he felt with all his questionable attributes that he could get away with this. At the end of the day these things continue to happen because Nigerians let them happen."", 'Honestly it is a very shameful, decision  to install an illegitimate candidate as a president while challenging his candidacy in court.

The civilian governments have always used the military as their bulldogs to suppress the voice of their citizens, which has immensely contributed to African countries' lack of progress right from their independence.\r\n\r\nThe best type of democracy suitable for African countries is a joint -Civilian democracy where all the security institutions (police, DSS, navy, air force, etc.) are under the control of the military and INDEPENDENT of the civilian government. Their duty would be to ensure that the civilian government governs according to the constitution and delivers the dividends of democracy to its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe military as an institution would also have its other main responsibilities of protecting the lives and properties of the citizens, protecting the sovereignty of their countries, having their own military inventions, science and technological institutions, hospitals, schools, etc. They will also have the responsibility of ensuring that their officers, men, and families also enjoy the good governance and dividends of democracy by making sure they are well catered for and proud to fight, protect, and die for the internal and territorial sovereignty of their country.\r\n\r\nWhen the citizens are dissatisfied with the policies of the civilian government and this is expressed through peaceful protests, the military can wade in to ensure the civilian government changes its policies for the betterment of the citizens.\r\n\r\nWhen the civilian government is not in control of the armed forces, their powers and tendency to oppress and suppress the people will be limited to the barest minimum.

This ties into the song\'s theme of the intersection between technology and human interaction, but at the same time has sexual connotation what is more recognizable. This gives amazing perspective on the songwriter\'s view of the modern human and the way people are in constant need of connection both with another human and technology.\nIn addition, the video features Milow himself playing an acoustic guitar, which can be seen as a symbol of the simplicity and authenticity of human connection. He is playing and singing to The Golden Girl, she symbolizes perfection, God-ness, someone who is so precious to him, the ""ideal girl"". At the same time video effect is in golden colors what can be interpreted in this context that he is seeing her through rose-tinted glasses, in other words in unrealistic light. \n\n🇲🇪 2023', 'I dalje jedna od najjačih pesama', 'I have been trying to remember the name of this song for years now.

They are afriad someone will bust open the enirety of the worlds scope in tyranny across the cosmos', 'Mr tom DeLonge was indeed right . And Joe u Called him crazy behind his back to Travis barker, and Travis did not disappoint, he basically did not respond', 'Dr Steven Greer has revealed numerous benevolent (positively-polarised) ETs that have become ever more prevalent in their visitations following the events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, Dr Greer is convinced there aren’t any malevolent (negatively-polarised) ETs, which I “believe” to be naive and yet uninformed upon the “Law of One”, though it would be great if so, however Dr Greer raises concerns of an impending hoax invasion to unite the global populous against a common enemy to form a world governance.\n\n-Law of One\n\nIn 1981 a UFO research group were able to successfully make contact with a higher-density (dimensional) entity identified as “Ra” (as in the Egyptian Ra). They achieved this after a decade of extensive practice in meditation and channelling, whereby upon successful contact they entered into a six month process of Q&A with the entity through multiple sessions; Q&A is established to not infringe upon the Law of Free Will. The entity Ra reveals that all is one. We are one. The universe—one of infinite universes—the galaxies, solar systems, planets and existing life are all fractals of expression of self-realising such oneness, unity, singleness (each fractal/expression, be it universe, black-hole, star, planet, being, is a centre of intelligence/creation/consciousness, termed “logos”, at its corresponding magnitude of existence; picture an inverted tree). You are infinity, you are unity, you are.\n\nThe universal octave consists of 7 main “densities”: 1st the elements/phases and inorganic matter, 2nd growth and movement (microbes, plants and animals), 3rd self-awareness (humans and other ET species), 4-7 exist as non-physical densities of higher consciousness expressed through light (electromagnetism), 4th love-light, 5th wisdom, 6th unity, 7th infinity (returning to source). The 4th to 7th densities can be viewed as the “heavens” and exist as quanta (bands/levels) of higher electromagnetic vibration, just as photons (electromagnetism) transfer information through radio waves, broadband/Wi-Fi, so too does consciousness carry more information in these higher densities, and as such is why “spiritually” evolved individuals appear to exist at a higher vibration/frequency of being (more “light”). The 3rd density experience provides our ability to choose polarity between service to self (negative) and service to others (positive). Each density consists of subdividing octaves within octaves forming the infinite musical scale of reality and is why upon observing the human species there are infinitely varying expressions of conscious intelligence each at one’s own level of vibration and sub-density of evolution and is how individuals form their social groups and partners based on the resonance and energetic coherence between entities (atoms forming bonds to create molecules within the social organism). Consciousness is a unified field to which we behave as antennae to it and through disciplined practice can raise our level of consciousness, unlocking new abilities and insights. Each energetic experience (emotional exchange) between individuals throughout one’s life causes a catalyst in which such energetic exchange provides lessons and conscious imprints (karma) to aid in conscious (spiritual) evolution. The ultimate aim is to achieve self-mastery and to evolve to higher densities upon one’s next incarnation (the soul never dies but simply transitions from one biological vessel to the next, not exclusive to one species and thus incarnations can occur on other planets to other species, until “graduating” to the non-physical densities to continue progression). Importantly, there is no bias, no duality, no polarity, all is one, but to the individual experience there exists the polarity of service (to self or to others).\n\nThe Earth logos as of 1936 is revealed to have transitioned into the 4th density meaning it was, in synergy with us as conscious agents, 51% positively polarised and as of 2012 entered a galactic photon stream (the actual galactic event to which said year is attributed in many cosmological cultures) and as such the Earth intelligence can receive more information in higher conscious intelligence. Such 4th density positive polarity can explain the overall positive orientation of society in the emerging social justice movements and raising of awareness throughout the decades as the literal conscious vibration of the planetary intelligence continues to evolve in said direction, akin with technological growth as greater insights are now possible, even with so much devastation also as there are those negatively polarised. More 4th density souls (and higher) can now incarnate upon the Earth in this new era of love-light, which is a physical-light “superimposed” hybrid of 3rd density (physical) and 4th density (light) and as such more individuals upon correct self-mastery and alignment/harmony can unlock heightened conscious abilities (powers) that are deemed “paranormal” to 3rd density beings, such as telepathy, healing, etc. and explains such a huge wave in spiritualism across the planet (the evolution from H. sapien to H. luminous just as the Earth is now Gaia). It is revealed Jesus was a 4th density soul graduating to 5th but who chose to incarnate when he did with the intention of teaching love and forgiveness and fortunately “remembered” his innate abilities early on (though “Jesus” (or Yeshua) is simply the vibratory form (name) given to said entity—naming is simply a 3rd density phenomena), as in 3rd density there is the “veil of forgetting” and is why we are under the illusion of living only this one life, but it itself acts as a catalyst in our spiritual evolution where we inhabit the Law of Free Will and our ability to choose our polarity of service to self or to others. Buddha was a 5th density soul incarnation and hence his teachings were more about wisdom absent of the expression of love. There are many such “wanderers” who choose to incarnate to Earth with the intention of service.\n\nRa reveals that it/they visited Earth circa ~12000 years ago to teach the Egyptian population the Law of One and ways to spiritually evolve, for the lifespan of said population had dropped to 30 years and so souls were simply incarnating without the time to achieve self-mastery and evolve. Although a 6th density “social-memory-complex” (one unified conscious intelligence consisting of many harmonised souls), Ra materialised in physical form and through using “thought forms” (higher conscious intention) and sound vibration constructed the pyramids as healing and initiation centres to access infinite intelligence (constructed with blocks as opposed to one uniform structure for the illusion of it being man-made).\n\nRa reveals that circa ~70,000 years ago another 5th-density positively-polarised social-memory-complex identified as “Yahweh” (as in the Biblical Yahweh) visited Earth and initiated genetic modifications, cloning and interbreeding to enhance the biological consistency and potential for attaining spiritual growth and as such humans of this time period lived to be ~900 years of age on average, but unfortunately, certain individuals identified in their superiority over others and as such negative-polarity ensued (egoic distortions) and said teachings were misused, as happened to Ra’s efforts in Egypt also, though another 6th density positively-polarised entity visited South America at the same time as Ra and such teachings were never distorted.\n\nRa also reveals that a negatively-polarised 5th density social-memory-complex known as the Orion Group (consisting of several civilisations) has also visited in such time-cycles and has also genetically modified, cloned and interbred in forming hybridised and slave races for negative agendas. Matias De Stefano is active today and recalls his past lives to which he profoundly details his life in Atlantis and how such a civilisation came to be, at first the invading ETs provided teachings for spiritual progression but overtime became dominating to the humans and the hybrid race formed which branched off to become the Egypt we know of from history. Many other timelines are revealed in our history but have been lost, forgotten or “wiped” from collective consciousness and memory.\n\nRa, Yahweh, Jesus and Buddha, among countless others are apart of a Galactic Confederation of many higher-density civilisations and entities (including Archangels and the like) who oversee the positive progression of those planetary species who are ready to evolve. Just as there are negatively-polarised civilisations and entities to counter such for selfish agendas. “Graduation” to higher densities can be in negative-polarity also, where 95% service to self is akin to the 51% service to others in order for “graduation”. There exists a “quarantine” around our planet which acts as a boundary to prevent nefarious visitation from other civilisations. This is said to have been put in place in recent history and is overseen by the “High Council” who supersede the Galactic Confederation in decisions which affect planetary evolutions. However, akin to the borders of nations, the quarantine can be breached.\n\nIn parallel to the seven densities of the universal octave of consciousness, each being consists of seven energy centres (chakras) of which the first three are active upon birth and through self-mastery the higher chakras activated. 1st instinct and survival (red), 2nd sex and emotion (orange), 3rd self-awareness and ego (yellow), 4th love (green), 5th wisdom (blue), 6th unity (indigo), 7th infinity (violet). The path of service to self (negative) typically skips 4th chakra activation while service to others activates the 4th chakra. All colours merge into white light. We are light/energy, but of what purity/vibration?\n\nSee reply for links…', 'This episode was cray cray!! I believe this whistleblower and everything he says.

And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. 6 Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. 7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves’ feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze. 8 The hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings. 9 Their wings touched one another. The creatures did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.\n\n19 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 20 Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 21 When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.\n\nThe wheel is said to be by the living creatures, who attended it to direct its motion; for the angels are employed as the ministers of God\'s providence, and have a greater hand in directing the motions of second causes to serve the divine purpose than we think they have. Such a close connexion is there between the living creatures and the wheels that they moved and rested together. Were angels busily employed? Men were busily employed as instruments in their hand, whether of mercy or judgment, though they themselves were not aware of it. Or, Are men active to compass their designs? Angels at the same time are acting to control and overrule them. This is much insisted on here (v. 19): When the living creatures went, to bring about any business, the wheels went by them; when God has work to do by the ministry of angels second causes are all found, or made, ready to concur in it; and (v. 21) when those stood these stood; when the angels had done their work the second causes had done theirs. If the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, were elevated to any service above the common course of nature and out of the ordinary road (as suppose in the working of miracles, the dividing of the water, the standing still of the sun), the wheels, contrary to their own natural tendency, which is towards the earth, move in concert with them, and are lifted up over against them; this is thrice mentioned, v. 19-21.\n\nSatan has minions and powers to deceive us and hurt God. It makes more sense to me that ""aliens"" are demonic entities. Satan is the “father of lies” in that he is the original liar. He is the “father” of lies Satan told the first lie in recorded history to Eve, in the Garden of Eden. After planting seeds of doubt in Eve’s mind with a question in Genesis 3:1. Satan directly contradicts God’s Word by telling her, “You will not certainly die” in Genesis 3:4. With that lie, Satan led Eve to her death; Adam followed, and so have we all. Lying is Satan’s primary weapon against God’s children. He uses the tactic of deceit to separate people from their heavenly Father. Some of his more common lies are “there is no God,” “God doesn’t care about you,” “the Bible cannot be trusted,” and “your good works will get you into heaven.” The apostle Paul tells us that Satan “masquerades as an angel of light” in 2 Corinthians 11:14, so that what he says and does sounds good and seems reasonable. But it is nothing more than a false appearance.          \n\n2 Corinthians 11:13-15 (NKJV)\n13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.                  \n\n Psalms 1:1-2 (NKJV)\n1 Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; 2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night. 🙏🏼', 'THe whisleblowser is lying, hes controlled oposition. just read his body language and hes lying eyes.', ""This is VERY credible stuff....Grusch has absolutely impeccable credentials...you won't find a Higher Level person......he gave the President daily briefings, and was literally trusted with the Highest classified information in the US Government possible every single day.
